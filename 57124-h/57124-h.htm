Throughout the volume many new illustrations
appear in place of those in the first edition, and
their selection has been made in order to show more
clearly the characteristics of the china as dealt with
in the letterpress.</p>

<p>In addition to these, twenty new illustrations have
been added, and I have to acknowledge my indebtedness
to Messrs. Wedgwood &amp; Sons, by whose
courtesy I am enabled to reproduce examples from
their museum at Etruria, and fine examples after
Flaxman, including specimens of dinner-ware which
are now being manufactured by the firm from the old
designs by that artist.</p>

<p>I have similarly to acknowledge my obligation to
Messrs. W. T. Copeland &amp; Sons, of Stoke-upon-Trent
(the successors of Spode), for several illustrations of
the ware from their factory, and to Messrs. Minton
for some fine specimens of their productions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span></p>

<p>It is my hope that this improvement will make
the volume more useful as a practical working handbook
for the collector.</p>

<p>To the great number of enthusiasts who have
written to me in connection with this volume and
with the <i>Dilettante</i> pages in the <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i>, I
tender a grateful and appreciative acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="ph3 p2">AUTHOR’S NOTE</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> regard to English Earthenware, which appeals
to a wide circle of collectors, I have, in response to
many readers who have written to me on the subject,
prepared a companion volume to this, entitled
“Chats on English Earthenware.” The subject is
treated from a collecting point of view, and a large
number of carefully selected photographic reproductions
of typical examples illustrate the letterpress.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in the outline sketch
of English Earthenware given in the concluding
chapters of this volume, and desire greater detail,
will find a completer record in the companion
volume.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little volume has been primarily written with
a view to enable the possessors of old china to
determine the factories at which their ware was
produced. A modest attempt has been made to
show that the china-shelf is a record of men’s
triumphs and failures, and the fantastic shepherds
and shepherdesses, lustrous bowls, queer printed
dishes, and bizarre decorated jugs, may be regarded
by a reflective mind as so many symbols representing
something less perishable than the clay of the
potter.</p>

<p>These “Chats” originally appeared in the pages
of <i>Our Home</i>. In collecting them in volume form
I trust that they will appeal to a wider circle of
readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span></p>

<p>Never was a greater interest taken in Art, and
the growth of popular literature has developed a taste
for objects of art in the home. The china-shelf
is now regarded as worthy of keen and discriminating
study. Its treasures, often heirlooms, have been
brought into the light of day, and amateur collectors
can now be numbered by thousands.</p>

<p>I am enabled to include a useful feature in the
list of prices obtained at recent sales, by kind
permission of the proprietors of the <i>Connoisseur</i>,
whose “Sale Prices,” published monthly, is most
valuable to the collector.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the Bibliography of works on
china and pottery may be of use to those who wish to
study the subject more deeply, and a copious Index
will prove useful for ready reference.</p>

<p>The “Chats” relating to Lustre Ware, Old
English Mugs, and Wedgwood are not upon English
china, but deal with earthenware; they are included
in the volume in order to increase its scope and
usefulness.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Mr. W. G. Honey, of Cork,
for kindly allowing me to reproduce specimens from
his collection which was exhibited at the Cork
Exhibition. I am indebted to Mr. A. Merrington
Smith, Fine Art Dealer, of Lowestoft, for information
concerning the recent unearthing of moulds and
fragments of china on the site of the old factory at
Lowestoft, a discovery of very great value. By
permission of the Coalport Company I am giving
specimens of their modern productions and some of
their marks not published before.</p>

<h2><a name="GLOSSARY_OF_TERMS_USED" id="GLOSSARY_OF_TERMS_USED">GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED</a></h2>


<div class="blockquot_class">

<p><i>Biscuit.</i>—The first stage of china after being fired.
It is white and porous, and ready for decoration.
Its surface resembles that of an ordinary clay
pipe.</p>

<p><i>China.</i>—A term used to include all porcelains.</p>

<p><i>Earthenware.</i>—All ware that, in contradistinction
to porcelain, is not translucent.</p>

<p><i>Glaze.</i>—The glassy substance applied to the surface
of pottery and porcelain.</p>

<div class="blockquot_class">

<p><i>Lead Glaze.</i>—The porcelains of Bow, Chelsea,
and other early factories contained as much
as 40 per cent. of oxide of lead. Modern
chinas contain less than half that, and some
glazes are “leadless.” As to the terrible
results of the use of this glaze on the health
of the potters, see Report of Professors
Thorpe and Oliver to Home Office on
subject (C. 9207, 1899).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Over-Glaze Decoration.</i>—Decoration after the
surface has received its transparent glaze.
This decoration admits of a wider range of
colours. On hard paste, such as Plymouth,
it stands flat on the surface; on soft paste,
such as Bow, it is partly incorporated.</p>

<p><i>Under-Glaze Decoration.</i>—Decoration applied to
the unglazed surface when in biscuit state;
the whole is then covered with transparent
glaze and refired.</p></div>


<p><i>Ironstone China.</i>—A term invented by Mason, who
took out a patent for his ware. It is not china,
but is a heavy class of earthenware highly decorated.
It was generally adopted by other
Staffordshire makers.</p>

<p><i>Moulds.</i>—The models from which china is made.
These are of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p><i>Opaque.</i>—Incapable of transmitting light. This distinguishes
pottery from porcelain.</p>

<p><i>Paste.</i>—The body or material of which porcelain is
made.</p>

<div class="blockquot_class">

<p><i>Hard.</i>—China which, on being broken, shows a
sparkling surface like that of a flint stone,
and is impervious to any staining by colour
applied to it. Plymouth and Bristol and
New Hall are the only true hard-paste
porcelains of this country.</p>

<p><i>Soft.</i>—China which, on being broken, shows a
porous surface capable of absorbing colour.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span></p>


<p><i>Porcelain.</i>—Commonly called china; is distinguished
from pottery by being translucent.</p>

<div class="blockquot_class">

<p><i>True Porcelain</i> is made from a mixture of two
minerals—<i>petuntse</i>, or “china stone,” and
<i>kaolin</i>, or “china clay,” with nothing artificially
added; <i>e.g.</i>, Chinese, Dresden, Plymouth,
and Bristol chinas.</p>

<p><i>Glassy Porcelain</i>, containing an artificial admixture
of glass to give the paste translucency;
<i>e.g.</i>, Chelsea, Bow, Nantgarw, Pinxton.</p>

<p><i>Bone-ash Porcelain</i>, of which Spode’s china is an
example.</p></div>


<p><i>Pottery.</i>—A term used to include all the earthenwares.</p>

<p><i>Printing.</i>—Formerly, in old chinas, all the coloured
decorations were painted. Now, by use of
various mechanical devices, women and girls
are employed to transfer printed patterns on
modern china.</p>

<p><i>Transfer-printing.</i>—A process used at Liverpool by
Sadler and Green, and at Worcester, in which
the design from an engraved copper plate was
transferred to specially prepared paper and
applied to the ware. Black and brown were
the main colours used (see Illustrations, pp.
<a href="#Page_244">244-5</a> and facing <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>).</p>

<p><i>Translucent.</i>—Transparent. All porcelains, when held
up to a strong light, are translucent, in varying
degree, according to thickness of paste.</p></div>

OLD DERBY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not too much to hope that the eyes of some
reader will stray into these pages as a wanderer in a
strange land, one whose interest in china has never
been awakened. We hope to lure such a wight with
sweet cajolery. If perchance we can get him to
examine one or two dainty specimens of old blue
china we shall have him enmeshed in our toils. If
he be an artist he will not escape from the enchantment
of Derby and of Worcester. If he be a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
business man, here is an item from Messrs. Christie’s
catalogue of a sale on January 14, 1902: “Coffee-pot
and cover, Worcester. Painted with figures, birds,
and flowers, in colours in Chinese taste, and with
alternate dark-blue scale-pattern panels—£28 7s.”
And this, mark you, is an ordinary item selected
at random, a business sample, if you will.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang, in one of his “Ballades in Blue
China,” has cunningly put into rhyme a poet’s reason
for his love of china:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There’s a joy without canker or cark,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">There’s a pleasure eternally new;</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis to gloat on the glaze and the mark</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of china that’s ancient and blue,</div>
<div class="verse">Unchipped all the centuries through,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It has passed, since the chime of it rang,</div>
<div class="verse">And they fashioned it, figure and hue,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In the reign of the Emperor Hwang.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We should be less than human if we did not point
the moral by quoting the delicious sentences of a
City man (one can hardly imagine Charles Lamb
a City man journeying daily to Leadenhall Street!)
concerning—</p>

<p>“Those little, lawless, azure-tinctured grotesques
that, under the notion of men and women, float
about, uncircumscribed by any element, in that
world before perspective—a china teacup.... Here
is a young and courtly mandarin handing tea to a
lady from a salver—two miles off. See how distance
seems to set off respect. And here the same lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
or another—for likeness is identity on teacups—is
stepping into a little fairy boat, moored on the
hither side of this calm garden river, with a
dainty, mincing foot, which, in a right angle of
incidence (as angles go in our world), must infallibly
land her in the midst of a flowery mead—a
furlong off on the other side of the same strange
stream!”</p>

<p>And now, having brought you thus far, reader,
will you not journey with us and learn something
of the magic and the mysteries of old china? We
are a goodly company, and if you have a fine eye,
a pretty fancy for your own taste, and a keen zest
for a bargain, join hands with us.</p>

<p>Derby holds a high place in the history of British
porcelain, inasmuch as it was here that its manufacture
was matured, and the ability and perseverance
of three generations of the Duesbury family raised
the productions to the level of those of the great
European factories.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the manufacture of
china first sprang into existence at Derby in 1750,
about a year or so before the works at Worcester
were established. There is a tradition that the first
maker was a Frenchman, who lived in a small house
in Lodge Lane, and who modelled and made small
articles in china, principally animals—cats, dogs,
lambs, sheep, &amp;c.—which he fired in a pipemaker’s
oven in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>About this time there were some pot works on
Cockpit Hill belonging to Alderman Heath, a
banker, and the productions of the Frenchman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
probably a refugee, having attracted notice, an
arrangement was made between him and Heath and
Duesbury by which the manufacture of porcelain
would be carried on jointly. This man’s name, to
whom the absolute honour of commencing the
Derby China Works belongs, was Andrew Planché.
A deed exists by which a partnership for ten years
was entered into by the three above named.
Planché found the skill and secret knowledge, Heath
the money (£1,000), and Duesbury the ability to
carry out the scheme.</p>

<p>Besides this deed there is no other record of the
Frenchman, as the firm became known as “Duesbury
and Heath,” and apparently the usual fate of
the poor inventor overtook Planché.</p>

<p>William Duesbury was of Longton Hall, in Staffordshire,
and was the son of a currier. By trade
he was an enameller. Entries in the family Bible,
in the possession of the Duesburys, prove that in
1755 he removed to Derby to carry on the newly-acquired
business “in ye art of making English
china, as also in buying and selling all sorts of
wares belonging to ye art of making china.”</p>

<p>Records of the kinds of china manufactured and
sent to London are interesting. There were blue
fluted boats, mosaic boats, sage-leaf boats, fig-leaf
sauce-boats, octagon fruit plates, vine-leaf plates,
coffee cups, flower vases, blue strawberry pots,
standing sheep, cats, honeycomb jars, coffee-pots,
butter-tubs, Chelsea jars, teapots, figures of Mars,
Minerva, &amp;c., Spanish shepherds, candlesticks, and,
of course, many varieties of plates and dishes, and
cups and saucers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span></p>

<p>Once or twice the name of the firm appears as
“Duesbury and Co.,” but it is more usually “Duesbury
and Heath.” Finally, it became Duesbury
only.</p>

<p>OLD DERBY MARKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Coming to the marks which were used, in our
illustration we have arranged them in chronological
order, the earliest being at the top.</p>

<p>The mark used in the earliest days is not certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
but in all probability the letter D, when in gold,
is one of the first used. It is, however, exceedingly
rare to find a piece thus marked. This letter D
may equally stand for Derby or for Duesbury.</p>

<p>From 1770 to 1773, the script initial
<img src="images/page_008.jpg" width="20" alt="D" />
and the
anchor known as the Derby-Chelsea or the Duesbury-Chelsea
mark was introduced, as William Duesbury
had purchased “the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory,
and its appurtenances and lease thereof,” on
February 5, 1770, and made this addition to the
Chelsea anchor. This mark of the Derby-Chelsea
period is usually in gold, and was used both at the
factory at Chelsea and at Derby. Examples of
this period are of comparative rarity, and are eagerly
sought after by collectors.</p>

<p>The Derby-Chelsea marks are given in the “Chat”
on Chelsea (<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>).</p>

<p>The works at Chelsea were not finally discontinued
till 1784, when they were destroyed by Duesbury,
the kilns and every part of the factory pulled down,
and what was available sent off to Derby. About
the year 1773, a <img src="images/page_008.jpg" width="20" alt="D" /> and a crown were used. This
mark is mostly in blue, but sometimes in puce, light
red, or green. This crown was added by Royal
permission, because the factory had been honoured
by Royal patronage.</p>

<p>Will my readers note that in the earlier pieces
of Derby and Crown-Derby china the crown is
carefully jewelled; in the later productions of the
Duesbury period the mark was rudely executed, and
the crown was hastily pencilled.</p>

spots, about the year 1782, there is the tradition

<p>We give as a headpiece a typical example of
early Crown-Derby. It represents a two-handled
covered cup and saucer decorated with the well-known
rich blue and gold border and festoons in
pink. It is marked in puce with jewelled crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
This specimen is from the national collection now
at the Bethnal Green Museum.</p>

<p>The vase we reproduce is 6<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> in. high and has
the crown and crossed batons and dots, which mark
has been photographed and appears in the illustration
(<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>). It is richly decorated and a good
specimen, as is the smaller vase, or pastille-burner,
with masks, and similarly marked (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>).</p>

<p>These two specimens, together with the Crown-Derby
mug and saucer, decorated in tomato red
and gold, are from the collection of Mr. W. G.
Honey, which was on view at the Cork Exhibition.</p>

<p>The first William Duesbury died in 1785. His
son, William, who had for the last few years been
in partnership with him under the firm of Duesbury
and Son, succeeded him. This second William
Duesbury increased the fortunes of Derby china
with astonishing rapidity. The King and Queen,
and the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.),
and the leaders of fashionable society were among
his customers. There was a craze for a time, and
titled ladies painted flowers and other pictures on
the porcelain supplied to them by the Derby factory.
It was afterwards fired and finished for their own
special use.</p>

<p>Of these ladies, Lady Margaret Fordyce, Lady
Plymouth, and Lady Aubrey executed some
beautiful drawings, which probably still remain in
their families. Lord Lonsdale had twenty-four
plates painted with landscapes in Cumberland after
his own sketches, and many other noblemen and
gentlemen did the same.</p>

<p>On the death of Duesbury the second, his widow
married his late partner, a Mr. Michael Kean, an
Irishman, and clever artist. This was in 1798. But
Kean hastily withdrew from the concern when the
third William Duesbury came of age, who for a time
carried on the factory under the firm of “Duesbury
and Sheffield.” In 1815 the premises passed into
the hands of Mr. Robert Bloor.</p>

<p>It was in the year of Waterloo that the third
William Duesbury, and last of the great family of
potters who had established the factory, leased the
premises to Mr. Robert Bloor, who had been a clerk
to his father, and had carried on the business during
Mr. Duesbury’s minority. Ultimately the entire
business passed into the hands of Mr. Bloor, and
the name of Duesbury disappears from Derby
records.</p>

<p>For some years up till about 1825 or 1830, Mr.
Bloor used the Old Derby mark, the crown, cross
daggers with dots, and D beneath, but about that
period he discontinued it, and adopted instead a
mark with his own name. It is well for readers
to note that down to the discontinuance of the old
mark, it had invariably been done with a pencil, but
those adopted by Mr. Bloor were printed.</p>

<p>In our illustrations of the other marks used at
Derby we place them in chronological order. The
first printed mark used under the Bloor régime was
the circle enclosing the crown, and the words “Bloor,
Derby,” printed around. In some specimens, of a
little later date, the mark is a trifle larger, and the
crown more carefully designed. Another mark used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
occasionally about the year 1830 was the word
“Derby” enclosed in a scroll; while on some other
specimens of about the same date, or a little later
an old English D, surmounted by a crown, is marked,
or the word “Derby” in Roman capitals on a ribbon,
appears beneath the usual crown.</p>

<p>We now come to a
rather painful chapter in
the history of the Old
Derby, practically a series
of misdoings, which terminated
the glorious career
of so famous a manufactory.
It is interesting
to see when trade, with
its somewhat ruthless
methods, comes into conflict
with art, with her
finer susceptibilities, how
art has to go to the wall.
It was the same story at
Derby.</p>

<p>Before Bloor’s time it
had been the unvarying
plan of the Duesburys—so
particularly jealous were
they of their reputation, and of maintaining the highest
possible character of the Derby ware—to allow only
perfect goods to leave the premises. However trivial
the fault, the articles were not considered good
enough to send out in the name of Derby. These
damaged wares had accumulated to a very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
extent at the manufactory. Mr. Bloor, who was not
a rich man, and who was filled with the very laudable
desire to make the Derby concern successful, and
who, moreover, had to pay off his purchase money by
instalments, caught at the chance of disposing of
this accumulation of Old Derby stock. Here it
was that his trade instincts overcame his love of
the fine arts. Better far had it been if the whole
buildings had been consumed by fire, and the old
stock destroyed, than that the damaged goods should
have been foisted upon the public. But it fell about
otherwise, and Mr. Bloor disposed of the Derby
failures by auction at the different large towns. By
this means he amassed great sums of money, which
brought him immediate capital, but which was the
death-blow to Derby ware. The old Derby was
eagerly bought, but this temporary success resulted
in permanent and never-to-be-remedied evil. Seeing
how readily the public bought up the Derby ware,
the temptation arose to produce large quantities of
the ware specially for the auction rooms. The
Duesburys would have risen in their graves had they
known of these proceedings; but Fate avenged them,
for the decline of the Derby factory commenced from
this moment.</p>

<p>We give, also from Mr. W. G. Honey’s collection, a
fine example of Bloor Derby china; it is five inches
in height, and is marked with a crown and the words
“Bloor, Derby,” in circle around (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>).</p>

<p>In 1845 Mr. Robert Bloor died, followed in the
next year by his brother Joseph, who had assisted
him for many years. For a little while the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
were in the hands of a Mr. Clarke, who finally
discontinued them and sold most of the models to
the Staffordshire manufacturers. The
end came in 1848, when a number of
the workmen left Derby for ever
and migrated into Staffordshire and
Worcester. Here, then, is the end of
the Old Derby works.</p>

<p>Old Derby china will, therefore, be
seen to be divided into two periods—the
great Duesbury period and the
declining period when Bloor became
a factor.</p>

<div class="figcenter w150">
<img src="images/page_020.jpg" width="150" height="664" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>LATER
DERBY MARKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A word or two to readers who
possess specimens of later Derby
may be of interest. Among our
marks will be seen several other
names connected with Derby. In
1848, when the works were closed,
a number of the old hands were
actuated by the desire to continue
the making of china at Derby
They, therefore, under the name of
Locker and Co., started a little
manufactory, and adopted the design
we give.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500"><a id="img_020"></a>
<img src="images/plate_001.jpg" width="500" height="573" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>DERBY FIGURE OF PEACOCK.</p>

<p>Richly painted and gilded. Tail in natural colours.

</div>

<p>Mr. Locker died in 1859, and the
works were then carried on in the
name of Stevenson and Co. Finally
we have the name of Courtney, who appears to have
been one of Bloor’s agents. Messrs. Stevenson and
Hancock adopted the last mark for their wares, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
persuasion by connoisseurs, who objected to the use
on modern Derby of the old mark of the crown,
cross daggers, and <img src="images/page_008.jpg" width="20" alt="D" />. The legacy which the Bloors
and some of the modern successors left to the name
of Derby is not a very happy one. The tampering
with the marks, or the bartering of modern as old, or
the disposal of damaged stock, all go to lessen the
faith of the public. As the years go on, the china
buyer becomes more discerning, and is not that
blind monster which manufacturers too often imagine
him to be.</p>

<p>In the hurried sketch we have given of the decline
of Old Derby we have little to say of the wonderful
biscuit ware which was one of the secrets of Derby,
which secret has now been lost. The biscuit figures
produced in the best days of Derby are unsurpassed
for fineness of modelling and beauty of finish. It
was in experimenting to find how Derby produced
this biscuit that Copeland discovered his celebrated
Parian ware.</p>

<p>There is a peculiar pleasure to the lover of
things old and things true in the unravelling of the
complicated chain which environs an old factory
such as Derby. The lives and ambitions of men,
fathers, sons, and grandsons, are bound up with
the traditions of the firm. Then trade had somewhat
the air about it of the old mediæval guilds. There
were secrets which no money could buy. All this
lies on the china shelf for you to read, if you care to.
Perhaps when your erring maid drops your Derby
cup and saucer you will philosophically remember
that it is not a cup and saucer, but only as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
autumn leaves that are strewn on the grave of
Duesbury, the potter—just a symbol to remind you
that man’s creations, after all, turn to dust and
ashes. But all that is very mournful, and mayhap
one shall find you later busy with fish-glue and
brush, at which pastime you will need to be a
philosopher too.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Old Derby China.</span></h3>

<p>With a history such as that of Derby, general
characteristics cannot be laid down, but certain
typical patterns were made at Derby. A favourite
pattern was the “French sprig” or “Chantilly,”
technically termed “129 sprig” at the Derby works,
being an imitation of the Angoulême china, painted
with a forget-me-not or small blue cornflower, and
a gold sprig laid on the white. This is of frequent
occurrence on fluted cups. Deep blue borders with
gold leafage and simple festoons in pink was a
characteristic decoration of early Crown Derby.
The “Japan” patterns of Derby during the last
years of the eighteenth century and early years of
the nineteenth, were profusely decorated with blue
and red, and often richly gilded.</p>

CHELSEA CHINA</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of Chelsea china is like that of the
celebrated Charles James Harrington Fitzroy
Yellowplush, “wropped in mystry.” The southwestern
corner of London has always been connected
with the making of pottery in some form or another.
To-day Messrs. Doulton carry on the tradition of
Lambeth and Vauxhall. Battersea was famed for
its enamelled ware, and Fulham had a factory
established by John Dwight, M.A., of Christ Church,
Oxford, the inventor of porcelain in England, to
whom a patent was granted in 1671 for his manufacture
of porcelain and stone ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition, with a light heart, circulated the fable
that the origin of the Chelsea works was owing to
the clay that was brought as ballast in ships from
Chinese ports. In a “Life of Nollekens” this
absurdity finds its way into print, but for all that
it is utterly without foundation. “The cunning
rogues produced very white and delicate ware, but
then they had their clay from China, which, when
the Chinese found out, they would not let the
captains have any more for ballast, and the consequence
was that the whole concern failed.”</p>

<p>Equally foolish and erroneous statements have
been made about other of the English factories, and
the difficulty of sifting real facts from a mass of chaff
in such factories as Bow or Lowestoft is very great.</p>

<p>In the early days of Chelsea, and, by the way, the
exact date of the establishment of the factory is not
known, the clay was obtained from Cornwall. Dr.
Martin Lister, in a work published in 1699, mentions
the fact that an inferior kind of porcelain was made
at Chelsea, probably little better than opaque glass.
It is known that a manufactory of glass was set up
at Chelsea by some Venetians under the auspices of
the Duke of Buckingham. It is interesting to note
that the Chelsea mark of an anchor is identical with
that of Venice. In 1745 the works at Chelsea had
attained a Continental fame, inasmuch as the French
company, in petitioning for the establishment of a
factory at Vincennes, urged that its aim was to
counteract the importation of English and German
ware.</p>

<div class="figcenter w475"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
<img src="images/page_031.jpg" width="475" height="685" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CHELSEA VASE. 24 IN. HIGH. (DATE 1762.)</p>

<p>Representing the Death of Cleopatra.</p>

<p><i>In British Museum.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>1745 is a very convenient date, as we then come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
on surer ground. The earliest dated example of
English porcelain known has the word, “Chelsea,
1745,” scratched on it under the glaze, and is also
marked with a triangle. We reproduce this mark
in our list of Chelsea marks.</p>

<p>Life was given to the Chelsea factory by the
patronage of George II., who did much to encourage
its work. He procured workmen, models, and
materials from Saxony and Brunswick, and thus
enabled Chelsea to enter into competition with
the best designs and productions of Dresden and
Sèvres. The Duke of Cumberland took a warm
interest in the factory, and contributed an annual
sum to its revenue. In 1750 we find the Chelsea
works in the hands of Nicholas Sprimont, a foreigner
of considerable artistic taste, who established the
reputation of Chelsea. The best period of Chelsea
ware is from this date till the year 1765. Porcelain
made between these two dates is always much sought
after, and brings considerable sums under the
hammer. For instance, in February, 1902, at
Christie’s, a Chelsea teapot, painted with birds and
trees in colours, in spiral panels, with borders of gilt
flowers, fetched £96 12s., and a pair of vases,
11<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> inches in height, square shaped, the four panels
painted with male and female Chinese figures,
sold for £588. In July, 1902, a figure of a Chelsea
shepherdess, brought £33 12s.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that at this time there were
being manufactured at Chelsea some very fine
specimens of porcelain. Horace Walpole writes,
in 1763, “I saw yesterday a magnificent service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
Chelsea china, which the King and Queen are sending
to the Duke of Mecklenburg. There are dishes
and plates without number, an epergne, candlestick,

<p>One pleasing feature is the
fact that Mr. Sprimont made a
handsome fortune by his skill
and industry as a director.
During his time, it is said that
“the china was in such repute
as to be sold by auction, and
as a set was purchased as soon
as baked, dealers were surrounding
the doors for that purpose.”
This fanciful scene of competing
dealers striving to secure a specimen
of Chelsea almost before it
was cooled from the furnace is
too picturesque to be literally
true.</p>

<p>We reproduce a figure of a
carpenter, eight inches high,
coloured, marked with anchor
in red (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>). This specimen of
Chelsea is now at the Bethnal
Green Museum. We give an illustration of a beautifully
decorated vase in the collection at the British
Museum, representing the Death of Cleopatra. The
French style of design is singularly evident in this
example (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Of the marks on Chelsea china, it may be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
that the earlier specimens, in the days when they
imitated blue and white Oriental models, are unmarked.
Later the anchor appears, embossed in a
raised oval, impressed on the bottom of the piece,
and bearing the anchor in relief. Various forms of
the anchor are used, and in
varying colours, apparently
according to the caprice of
the workman, who drew it
with his hair-pencil. Red is
the colour most commonly used,
and the best pieces are mostly
marked in gold, with the anchor
more carefully drawn.</p>

<p>[Chelsea Marks].</p></div>
</div>

<p>Specimens with the double
anchors are very valuable, as this
was a mark only used on very
high-class pieces.</p>

<p>The triangle is one of the
marks of Bow, and the little
milk-jugs in the form of a goat,
decorated with raised flowers,
were attributed to Bow, on
account of this mark, but the
last mark we give shows beyond
dispute that the triangle was
also used as a Chelsea mark.</p>

<p>Having told of the rise and progress of Chelsea,
we have regretfully to chronicle its fall. The
following contemporary advertisement is mournful
reading: “To be sold by auction, by Mr. Burnsall,
on the premises, some time in March next (1764),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
at the Chelsea Porcelain Factory, everything in
general belonging to it, and all the remaining unfinished
pieces, glazed and unglazed; some imperfect
enamelled ditto, of the useful and ornamental; all
the materials; the valuable and extensive variety
of fine models in wax, in brass, and in lead; all
the plaster moulds, and others; the mills, kilns,
and iron presses; together with all the fixtures of
the different warehouses; likewise all the outbuildings,
etc., etc. And, as Mr. Sprimont, the
sole possessor of this rare porcelain secret, is advised
to go to the German spaw, all his genuine houshold
furniture, etc., will be sold at the same time.</p>

<p>“N.B.—Soon after, when everything is sold
belonging to the manufactory and the large warehouse
cleared, there will be some most beautiful
pieces of the truly inimitable Mazarine blue,
crimson, and gold, that Mr. Sprimont has thought
deserving finishing; that will be sold at Chelsea,
as the whole remaining and the last produce
of that once most magnificent porcelain manufactory.”</p>

<p>This was in 1764, but no purchaser came forward,
and the factory lingered on till 1769, when again
we find it advertised, and the end of Chelsea china is
very near, Mr. Sprimont having entirely left off
making the same. Josiah Wedgwood had some
idea of purchasing some of the Chelsea china:
“There’s an immense amount of fine things,” he
writes to Bentley. But at this date, Mr. William
Duesbury, of the Derby manufactory, took over the
Chelsea works as he had previously taken over those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
of Bow, and carried them on for some years until
1784, when he pulled down the buildings, and removed
all that was useful to his factory at Derby,
and thus the manufacture of Chelsea china came
to an end.</p>

</div>

<p>The earliest examples of Chelsea china were in
imitation of the ordinary blue Delft patterns, but
later, Oriental patterns were very successfully copied,
both in blue and white, and in mixed colours. Both
Sèvres and Dresden were then adopted as models,
and with very fine results. The colours were
remarkably vivid, and only skilful artists were
employed, the specimens they turned out being
exquisitely decorated and finely conceived. The
fine vases in the French style in imitation of Sèvres,
with <i>gros bleu</i>, crimson, turquoise, and apple-green
were made from 1760 to 1765.</p>

<p>Later, debased French forms were copied and an
over elaboration was employed which marked the
decadence of Chelsea. This over elaboration in
art often marks the period of its decline. When
wood engraving attempted to copy the refinements
and delicacy of steel engraving it exceeded its
limitations. To-day the glass-blower of Venice
commits the same blunder when he, with false art
puts lace patterns on his glass ware.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE “FOUNDLING” VASE.</p>

<p><i>In the Collection of the Earl of Dudley.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The two most important specimens of Chelsea
china, both from their size and quality, are undoubtedly
the “Chesterfield” vase, and the “Foundling”
vase. They are two feet high, with bold
<i>rococo</i> scroll handles, surmounted by dome-shaped
covers; they are painted with pastoral subjects on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
white medallions. The reverse sides are painted
with exotic birds of rich plumage, and the body
or ground of the vase is of a rich <i>gros bleu</i> colour.
The former was bought for £2,000 by the Earl
of Dudley, and the latter, which was a gift to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
Foundling Hospital, was sold by the Governors to
the same nobleman, and they are now both at Dudley
House. We give an illustration of the celebrated
“Foundling” vase.</p>

<p>The raised flowers arranged in vases and ornamental
figures were a feature of
Chelsea ware; butterflies, bees, and
other insects were introduced
among the leaves, and the modelling
was always well done. We
reproduce a characteristic piece of
Chelsea with delicate work, and exhibiting
many of the individualities
of Chelsea design (<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>).</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Derby-Chelsea
Marks.</p>

<p>Mark Copied from
Chinese ——.</p></div>
</div>



<p>As the earliest specimens of
Chelsea were unmarked they can
only be judged by the body, the
general style of workmanship, and
the glaze. The ordinary Chelsea
marks we have already given, but
we now give the marks which
were used by Mr. Duesbury for a
time when he was proprietor both
of the Derby works and those of
Chelsea. This ware is known as
“Derby-Chelsea” ware, and is
very much sought after. There are some finely
enamelled plates in the Victoria and Albert Museum
with the mark we give. They are magnificent specimens
of the Derby-Chelsea and are scarcely distinguishable
from their Oriental prototypes except in
the softness of the paste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span></p>

<p>It is interesting to remember that Dr. Johnson
thought he could discover a means of further perfecting
the Chelsea china. He applied to the proprietors,
who allowed him to fire his compositions
in their ovens at Chelsea. The worthy lexicographer
attended there about twice a week and stayed all
day, accompanied by his housekeeper, who brought a
basket of provisions with her. Nothing, however,
came of the experiments.</p>

<p>In taking leave of Chelsea we must remember
that its success was an encouragement for the
formation of manufactories in other parts of the
country during the closing years of the eighteenth
century. The workmen trained there under Sprimont
found their way to Derby and to Worcester,
and to parts of Staffordshire, and carried their
experience with them. If for nothing else Chelsea
deserves to be remembered as an art centre; and
although Sprimont broke down in health and had
to go to the “German spaw,” and leave his pictures to
be sold at Christie’s, for all that, Chelsea spelt
success.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Chelsea China.</span></h3>

<p>The glaze is a softer milky white, and is not so
thick as that on Bow pieces. It is carefully finished
in every detail. The figure subjects are not so
crudely painted as those of Bow. Three spots unglazed
are sometimes found on Chelsea plates and
dishes, caused by the three points on which pieces
have rested. Chelsea china is remarkable for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
great weight. The bases and rims, particularly of
smaller pieces, are ground quite smooth. Just above
the rim black specks and small tears of the coagulated
glaze are noticeable. As in Bow, an insect or
spray was sometimes cleverly painted over flaws and
defects.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE BOW CHINA FACTORY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this “Chat” we shall treat of the wonderful
porcelain made at Bow, or “New Canton,” as the
makers called their factory on the banks of the
Lea. It was established about 1730, and it ceased
about 1776. That is to say, it commenced with the
reign of George II. and continued for a short time
during the reign of George III. Pope was not
dead, Fielding was writing his novels, Burke was
electrifying the country with his genius, the great
Doctor Johnson was in the midst of his Dictionary,
David Garrick was holding the town in a spell by
his art, and Sir Joshua Reynolds was, with his
brush, perpetuating the beauties of his day, while
Burns and Scott, Wordsworth and Coleridge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Byron, Thackeray, and Dickens were then in the
unborn future.</p>

</div>

<p>So this porcelain of Bow comes to us direct from
the eighteenth century. We have been taught to
regard the eighteenth century as a period of lace-ruffles
and wigs, of powder and of patches, of dull,
insipid ladies, of hard-drinking squires, of rough
soldiers—a century with little or no love of art,
when Shakespeare had been almost forgotten. Of
its china, certainly, we call up only a picture of
ugly grinning monsters, and little meaningless
gee-gaws—snuff-boxes and patch-boxes, and china<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
handles for walking-sticks; but a glance at what
Bow produced dispels so crude an idea at once, and,
let us hope, for ever. Bow, in its own field, is worthy
to stand by the side of what Sir Joshua has left us,
and what Gainsborough bequeathed to posterity as
poetic memories in paint and canvas of “dead
women, loved and gone.”</p>

<p>As in our other “Chats” on Derby and Worcester
and Chelsea, so with Bow, we shall have to tell of
the human lives that have gone to the making of
these fragile porcelain figures, all that is left to us
of dead men’s life-work—which Polly or Molly or
Elizabeth Ann may demolish by a fatal twist of the
feather-brush. A patent was taken out by Edward
Heylin, in the parish of Bow, and Thomas Frye,
of the parish of West Ham, in 1744, for a new
method of manufacturing “a certain mineral, equal
to, if not exceeding in goodness and beauty, china
or porcelain ware imported from abroad. The
material is an earth, the produce of the Cherokee
nation in America, called by the natives <i>unaker</i>.”
In 1749, Thomas Frye took out, alone, a second
patent “for a new method of making a certain ware,
which is not inferior in beauty and fineness, and is
rather superior in strength, than the earthenware
that is brought from the East Indies, and is
commonly known by the name of China, Japan, or
Porcelain Ware.”</p>

<p>A word or two concerning Frye. Our Irish
readers will be glad to learn that he was born at
Dublin, in 1710. He came to London in 1738, when,
he painted a portrait of Frederick, Prince of Wales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
for Saddlers’ Hall. At the establishment of the
Bow factory he took the management. To bring
the china to perfection, he spent fifteen years of his
life among furnaces, which had so bad an effect
upon his health that his constitution nearly broke
down. In 1759 he had to go to Wales for a change
of air, and in 1760 he returned to London, and we
find him taking a house at Hatton Garden, where
he executed some important mezzotint engravings—which,
as Mr. Rudyard Kipling observes, “is another
story.” He died of consumption in 1762. Perhaps
Oliver Goldsmith had him in mind (who knows?)
when he wrote his line—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There the pale artist plies his sickly trade.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To ladies it will be especially interesting to read that
Frye had two daughters, who assisted him in painting
the china at Bow.</p>

<p>Readers will, before now, have come to the
conclusion that the study of old china is not
superlatively easy, and that the question of marks
is at the best a vexed one. Should there be any
who have any lingering doubts on this point, they
will speedily join the majority when they come to
consider the bewildering marks of the Bow factory.
These same marks, be it said, have puzzled experts
who have denied each other’s conclusions, though
with hardly as much vehemence as the late Mr.
Bret Harte’s learned society “Upon the Stanislaus,”
who engaged in conflict “with the remnants of a
palæozoic age” in shameful manner—</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Bow Factory—Marks.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We give one set of the known marks of the
Bow factory, later we shall give
another set no less puzzling.
It is difficult to attempt to
offer any definite conclusions,
or to do more in the space
at our disposal than to state
that these are marks known to
have been used at Bow, and
are upon specimens in the
national or well-known private
collections. The letter B and
the drawn bow, of course, explain
themselves. The crescent
in blue and the sword and
anchor in red occur together
on a china figure of a sportsman
with a gun. It is conjectured
that the introduction
of a dagger may have been
due to the fact that both proprietors
were freemen of the
City of London, and the dagger,
as is well known, is part of the
City arms. The triple mark
of the anchor with the vertical and horizontal
daggers, by some collectors is ascribed to early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Chelsea, by others to Worcester; it is a disputed
point.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">

<div class="caption"><p>BOW FACTORY MARKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The little figure we reproduce (on <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>) is of a
woman playing the <i>pastorella</i>. It is one of a pair of
figures. The other represents
a man singing. Each figure
is marked in red with both
anchor and dagger. The
<i>pastorella</i> represented in the
figure was a musical instrument
in general use previously
to the introduction of the spinet.
It may be remarked that at
the back of each of these
figures, near the base, a square
hole has been pierced before
glazing, for the purpose of
receiving a metal stem supporting
nozzles for candles.
As this square hole is said
never to be found on similar
Chelsea pieces, it has come to
be regarded as a distinctive
feature of old Bow figures.</p>

<p>Among the various articles
made at the Bow factory may
be enumerated the following,
which have been taken from
the account-books of the factory: Shepherds and
shepherdesses, cupids, fluter, fiddler, harlequin, columbine,
pierrot or clown, tambourine player, Dutch
dancer, woman with chicken, birds on pedestals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
swans, boars, squirrels, goats, as well as many
miscellaneous articles for general use, such as salt-boxes,
candlesticks, mugs, pickle-stands, &amp;c. We
reproduce an inkstand, four inches in diameter, of
white glazed porcelain decorated with flowers,
which decoration we call attention to as being
characteristic of Bow. An inscription appears at
the top: “Made at New Canton, 1751” (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>).</p>

<p>Since Chaucer’s day, Stratford-le-Bow has come
down to us in rhyme, for the poet playfully pokes
fun at the good nun in his “Canterbury Tales”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And Frenche she spake ful fayre and fetishly</div>
<div class="verse">After the scole of Stratford-atte-Bow,</div>
<div class="verse">For Frenche of Paris was to her unknowe.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But should china collectors who travel down the
Great Eastern Railway wish a further fillip to remind
them of Bow, sundry soap and candle factories, with
stench so strong that it knocks at the railway
windows, will arrest their straying thoughts. The
literary reader may, when he catches glimpses of
the brown and oily ooze of the River Lea, think of
Coleridge’s lines to Cologne and the River Rhine.</p>

<p>And here at Bow linger still the memories of the
old factory—a century old—where Quin as Falstaff
was turned out in porcelain, and Garrick posed as
Richard III. in a china figure. A match factory
stands on the site of the old Bow China factory,
but there is still a “China Row” to suggest the old
days of “New Canton” and its wares.</p>

Bow porcelain, and portions of “saggers” on the site

</div>

<p>The children of the neighbourhood were observed
to have as playthings bits of broken china of a high-class
and delicate ware, never emanating from the
china shops of Bow, and Mr. Higgins, attached to
the match factory, henceforth kept strict watch over
the excavations, and careful examination unearthed
a number of broken specimens of the Bow ware.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
He and his sister carefully arranged the broken
pieces, and they form an excellent authority, these
trays of broken china, for determining the paste and
glaze, and identifying the decoration and designs of
Bow. By means of this find it was possible to
classify many doubtful pieces of china in well-known
collections hitherto wrongly attributed to other
factories. This discovery by excavation was followed
many years later by a similar find at Lowestoft.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that among the fragments
found, not a single piece is of Delft or common
earthenware, but all are of porcelain. The designs
of many of them are of Chinese landscapes, with
flowers, figures, and birds. Their general character
may be gathered from sketch of four examples.
They are all painted in blue with the exception of
a cup painted with green leaves and crimson-lake
flowers. None of the pieces is printed, but all are
painted with a brush. The other two illustrations we
give are of china ornamented in relief, the favourite
pattern being the mayflower. Each of these Bow
cups is a typical example. The design stands out
very sharply, and is raised from the surface of the
china. The cups are rather heavy for their size.</p>

<p>Among the <i>débris</i> were found many pieces of an
ornamental character, a salt-cellar beautifully
modelled, formed of three shells, with smaller shells
and seaweed between, but the upper shell to hold
the salt is missing. Pieces of dishes, evidently
intended to hold sweetmeats, were unearthed from
this sewer hole, with finely designed corals and shells
and seaweeds. Some natural shells were also found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
which had evidently served the artists as models.
Two china pug-dogs were discovered with collars
bearing roses on them.</p>

<p>Bow paste is exceedingly hard, and the fracture
when it is broken is close and compact. The pieces
as a rule are very heavy for their size, but many of
the cups and saucers are almost of egg-shell thinness.
The colour is milky white. Should any of our
readers be possessed of Bow china, they may ratify
its origin by carefully examining it, if possible,
under a magnifying glass. On scrutinising the blue
pieces it will be found there is a peculiarity in the
glaze, which arises in this manner. At that time blue
was the only known colour that would bear the
intense heat of the kiln. It was always painted on the
biscuit before being dipped in the glaze. It is found
that certain portions of the blue, however slight, are
apt, while the glaze is in a fluid state, to spread
over the surface, giving it a blue tinge. The other
colours as well as the gold were painted over the
glaze, and set in a kiln of lower temperature. Hence
the blue, being <i>under the glaze</i>, is imperishable, and
the other colours from frequent use get rubbed off.</p>

<p>We have given a number of marks used at Bow;
we supplement that list by two others, one of
which is exclusively composed of signatures actually
used by Thomas Frye himself.</p>

<p>Although none of the ware unearthed at Bow was
printed, yet printed ware did come from there. In
all probability it was sent to Liverpool to have the
transfer engravings, so much in vogue when Bow
flourished, put on the china. As early as the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
1756 this was done, for certain entries appear in the
Bow books: “One pint <i>printed</i> mug: a sett compleat
of the second <i>printed</i> teas.” Or it is possible
that they were sent to Battersea to be printed. It is
not a far cry from Bow to Battersea. Transfer printing
on enamel was in vogue at Battersea before 1755.
Horace Walpole, writing to a friend in 1755, says, “I
send you a trifling snuff-box,
only as a sample of the new
manufacture at Battersea, which
is done with copper-plates.”
But Battersea and Battersea
enamel—that is another story.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this
“Chat” on old Bow china will
have helped readers, to whom
Bow is a name, to form some
idea of what went on there
more than a century ago. The
china cabinet holds more mysteries
within it than many a
good housewife dreams of. It
will be seen that the difficulties
of china-collecting are legion.
At the modern find at Bow, lovers of china ought
to be grateful, for it enabled many vexed questions
to be settled, but what is Bow and what is
Chelsea still puzzles experts. In all probability
Bow, Bristol, and another very much debated
factory, Lowestoft, will continue to offer traps and
snares and pitfalls for the unwary collector (or
misshapen falsities attributed to them) till connoisseurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
are no more and collecting days are done.
The find in 1903 at Lowestoft is as important as the
find at Bow, but it is exceedingly unlikely that
any more facts will ever come to light respecting
these old factories; every available source of information
has been tapped and all that can be
known concerning them is known. The potters
who made the exquisite shapes, the artists who
painted the roses on bowl and beaker, have long
since departed with the roses of yester-years. Their
life-work is scattered. Much of it, perhaps most of
it, is gone for ever. Each cup and each dish of the
long-dead artist is like “a good deed in a naughty
world.” To-day, with a handful of facts, collectors
and connoisseurs wrangle together over theories.</p>

<p>Disputes have been held as to the origin of certain
pieces of puzzling technique. Some experts have
believed them to be Chelsea or Longton Hall.
Even the “Craft Bowl,” one of the earliest pieces
of Bow china, now at the British Museum, is
known to have been decorated in a kiln at Kentish
Town.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Bow China.</span></h3>

<p>Body and glaze often defective, pattern so arranged
as to cover flaw. Insects often introduced for this
purpose to hide imperfections. Coarse, chalky white
ware, covered with glaze much pitted and speckled.
The bottom often shows three marks representing
points on which piece rested in kiln. The glaze is
thickly applied, and fills up interstices of raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
patterns. The body and glaze varied; the earlier
pieces have a yellow tinge in the glaze. The
bottoms of some basins and dishes are often twice
as thick as the sides. The ware, owing to large
amount of lead used, is discoloured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> old Worcester china there lies a magic that
appeals to the collector of fine copies and adaptation
from Nankin and other Chinese porcelain.
The real old blue colouring of Worcester has a
charm about it which cannot be reproduced nowadays.
There is something personal about the productions
of the old factories; the workman was
proud to make his mark at the bottom of the plate
or bowl he had created, much in the same manner as
the masons who built Fountains Abbey left each man
his mystic sign on each stone he carved.</p>

<p>If the reader chooses to weave a romance of airy
nothingness on an old cracked bowl of Worcester
blue there is substance enough, if he has the mind to
do so. Mr. Austin Dobson, in one of his charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
villanelles, has taught us how much lies in the dreamy
depths of a plate with queer Chinese blue figures on
it:—</p>

<p>We have already given the story of old Derby
china, and when Derby and Chelsea and Bow were
establishing for themselves a reputation, Worcester
was engaged in experimenting in the same direction
in the person of one Dr. John Wall, a physician of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
that city. He was a man of considerable taste,
and besides being a clever practitioner, he was a
practical chemist, and an artist of some ability.
One of his paintings hangs in the hall of Merton
College, Oxford, of which he was a Fellow. He
was an etcher, and designed stained-glass windows;
one of his windows is at Oriel College. What
William Duesbury was to Derby and the foundation
of the china factory there, and what Josiah
Wedgwood was to Staffordshire, that was Dr. John
Wall to Worcester. His was the guiding intellect of
the Worcester enterprise, which culminated in 1751,
about a year after Derby had been established, in the
establishment of a manufactory of porcelain in the
“faithful city.”</p>

<p>These were restless times, very troublesome then
to domestic England, and having an influence upon
art. Only six years prior to this the Pretender had
invaded England with an armed force, and had penetrated
as far as Derby. Party feeling ran very high.
It has been asserted that the industry was introduced
to Worcester for political reasons, so that the Georgian
party might gain votes in the county against the
Jacobites, who were strong in Worcester. It seems
certain enough that Dr. Wall began his experiments
merely for the love of the study, but whether he was
used by politicians, or whether he used them, is of no
moment to us; suffice it to say that the Worcester
Porcelain Company was founded in 1751, and among
the prominent co-operators with Dr. Wall were
William Davies, an apothecary, and Edward Cave,
the founder of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
latter was of inestimable use to the factory for
advertising their wares.</p>

<p>The earliest Worcester productions were based
entirely on Chinese models. Small cups, without
handles, of Oriental design were decorated under the
glaze in blue. All the characteristics of the Nankin
ware became those of Worcester. Slowly and surely
they attempted with complete success some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
more brilliant colours of Eastern ceramic ware,
notably from the Japanese.</p>

<p>Finely painted exotic birds in colour.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The early ware of Worcester may be known by
a peculiar greenness of hue in the body of the china.
The first mark used was the letter W in some form
or another. This letter may stand either for Wall or
for Worcester, as D marked on Derby china may
stand either for Duesbury, the founder, or for Derby.
We reproduce several of the earliest Worcester
marks. About the same time a crescent was used,
which is believed to have been adopted from the
arms of the Warmstrey family, in whose ancient
mansion the factory was first started.</p>

<p>The first two letters, <img src="images/page_071.jpg" width="20" alt="W" />
, in script, were used when
the factory was under the direction of Dr. Wall, who
died in 1776. The capital W was marked in blue
on early printed china. The crescent in outline was
one of the earliest marks, while the second crescent
filled in with blue, under the glaze, occurs on
blue-printed china, which was invented about
1755.</p>

<p>Among other early Worcester marks are assimilations
and variations of certain Chinese characters,
probably from the models which the Worcester
potters copied. Of the square marks, it may be
observed that they do not always occur on Chinese
patterns. Occasionally, too, a crescent in red is
found with one of these squares in blue. Of the
other ornate and curiously Eastern adaptations, it
may be that they were workmen’s signatures, but
they are only found on old Worcester. The love for
Oriental flourishes is shown by a series of numbers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
Examples from 1 to 9 are known. We reproduce the
numbers 1, 4, 5, 7.</p>

<p>In 1756 the important invention of transferring
printed impressions from copper plates was introduced
at Worcester. It is debatable ground whether
Battersea, Liverpool, or Worcester invented it. But
in 1757 it had arrived at a wonderful state of perfection
at Worcester. The engraver, Robert Hancock,
was employed. Valentine Green, the great
mezzotint engraver, was his pupil. A mug bearing
the head of the King of Prussia, and dated 1757,
is held to be one of the most characteristic pieces of
this period.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle has a graphic description of one
of these King of Prussia mugs, which piece of prose
is worth giving in full, for we do not often see the
historian of the French Revolution in the character of
a china connoisseur:—</p>

<p>“There stands on this mantelpiece,” says one of
my correspondents, the amiable Smelfungus, in
short, whom readers are acquainted with, “a small
china mug, not of bad shape, declaring itself, in
one obscure corner, to be made at Worcester,
‘R. I., Worcester, 1757’ (late in the season, I
presume, demand being brisk); which exhibits all
round it a diligent potter’s apotheosis of Friedrich,
hastily got up to meet the general enthusiasm of
English mankind. Worth, while it lasts unbroken,
a moment’s inspection from you in a hurrying
along.</p>

<p>“Front side, when you take our mug by the
handle for drinking from it, offers a poor, well-meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
china portrait, labelled, King of Prussia:
copy of Friedrich’s portrait by Pesne, twenty years
too young for the time, smiling out nobly upon you;
upon whom there descends with rapidity a small
Genius more like Cupid, who had hastily forgotten
his bow, and goes headforemost on another errand,
to drop a wreath far too small for ever getting on
(owing to distance, let us hope), though the artless
painter makes no sign; and indeed both Genius
and wreath, as he gives them, look almost like
a big insect, which the King will be apt to treat
harshly if he notice it. On the opposite side, again,
separated from Friedrich’s back by the handle, is
an enormous image of Fame, with wings, filling half
the mug, with two trumpets going at once (a bass,
probably, and a treble), who flies with great ease;
and between her eager face and the unexpectant
one of Friedrich (who is 180 deg. off, and knows
nothing of it) stands a circular trophy, or imbroglio
of drums, pikes, muskets, canons, field flags, and
the like; very slightly tied together, the knot, if
there is one, being hidden by some fantastic bit of
scroll or escutcheon, with a Fame and <i>one</i> trumpet
scratched on it; and high out of the imbroglio rise
three standards inscribed with names, which we
perceive are intended to be names of Friedrich’s
victories; standards notable at this day, with names
which I will punctually give you.</p>

<p>“Standard first, which lies to the westward or
leftward, has ‘Reisberg’ (no such place on this
distracted globe, but meaning Bevern’s <i>Reichenberg</i>,
perhaps), ‘Reisberg,’ ‘Prague,’ ‘Collin.’ Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
standard curves beautifully round its staff, and
gives us to read ‘Welham’ (non-extant, too; may
mean <i>Welmina</i> or Lobositz), ‘Rosbach’ (very
good), ‘Breslau’ (poor Bevern’s, thought a <i>victory</i>
in Worcester at this time!). Standard third, which
flies to eastward or right hand, has ‘Newmark’
(that is, <i>Neumarkt</i> and the Austrian bread-ovens,
December 4th); ‘Lissa’ (not yet <i>Leuthen</i> in
English nomenclature); and Breslau again, which
means the capture of Breslau city this time,
and is a real success, December 7th to 19th;
giving as the approximate date, Christmas, 1757, to
this hasty mug. A mug got up for a temporary
English enthusiasm, and for the accidental instruction
of posterity. It is of tolerable china, holds a
good pint, ‘to the Protestant hero with all the
honours,’ and offers, in little, a curious eyehole into
the then England, with its then lights and notions,
which is now so deep-hidden from us, under volcanic
ashes, French revolutions, and the wrecks of a
hundred very decadent years.”</p>

<p>This mug bears the letters “R. H.” on it, the initials
of the engraver.</p>

<p>In addition to this portrait of Frederick the Great
there were others engraved of George II., George III.,
Queen Charlotte, the Marquis of Granby, and William
Pitt. The full signature of Robert Hancock is
often found on garden scenes and Watteau-like
subjects.</p>

<p>We illustrate as a headpiece a group of two cream-jugs
and a sugar-basin with black Worcester transfer-printed
subjects on them.</p>

<p><i>In Collection of Mr. W. G. Honey.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Leaving poetry and coming to fact, we arrive at
the beginning of the second period in the history of
the Worcester factory. Dr. Wall, the originator of
the works, had died in 1776, and it must be borne in
mind by the collector that from about the year 1764,
when the Chelsea works became disorganised, up to
the death of Dr. Wall, some of the most exquisite
creations of Worcester were produced. Several of
the Chelsea artists had come to Worcester, and mugs
of a choice apple-green were made in imitation of the
Sèvres ware, but none of these bear the Worcester
mark. Vases with rich <i>bleu-de-roi</i> ground and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
salmon-scale markings, with exotic birds of rich
plumage, of varied and elegant design, belong to this
period, and command at the present day very high
prices. Donaldson and O’Neale were two of the best
painters, and painted some of the finest Worcester
vases so much sought after. At the Victoria and
Albert Museum, in the collection of the late Lady
Charlotte Schreiber, there
are some particularly fine
examples.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">
<img src="images/page_078.jpg" width="250" height="479" alt="Flight and Barr Marks. Chamberlain Marks." />
</div>

<p>We reproduce a fine
Worcester dish (10<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> in. by
8<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> in.) from the collection
of Mr. W. G. Honey, recently
at the Cork Exhibition.
This specimen is an
excellent example of the
best period, and is marked
with a blue crescent.</p>

<p>In 1783 the works passed
into the hands of Mr.
Thomas Flight, who, together
with his two sons,
Joseph and John, raised
the manufactory to some
eminence. In 1788, George
III., with Queen Charlotte, visited the works, and
the title “Royal” was added to the mark, above the
word “Flight.” Later on, in 1791, Mr. Martin Barr
joined the concern, the firm becoming “Flight and
Barr.” It should be noted that Mr. Chamberlain, the
head of the decorating department of the old factory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
never came under the Flight <i>régime</i>, but established
a factory of his own at Worcester. We give in order
of date the various marks used both by his factory
and that of the Flights.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">
<img src="images/page_079.jpg" width="250" height="311" alt="Kerr and Binns Marks. Grainger, Lee and Co. Marks" />
</div>

<p>These two factories continued as rivals until 1840,
when they amalgamated, and the two firms formed
one company. The name of Flight and Barr
disappears, and the business being carried on at
Messrs. Chamberlain’s premises, the new Worcester
mark became “Chamberlain
&amp; Co.” In
1850 Mr. W. H. Kerr
joined the company,
and for a little while
the firm was known as
“Chamberlain, Lilley, &amp;
Kerr.” In 1852 another
change took place, Mr.
Chamberlain and Mr.
Lilley retired, and Mr.
R. W. Binns entered
into partnership with
Mr. Kerr. From that
time the manufactory, under the management of
Kerr &amp; Binns was known as “W. H. Kerr &amp; Co.”
It is important that the collector should know all
these transitions in the ownership and management
of the Worcester works, which has a continuous
history of nearly a hundred and fifty years, a record
not reached by any other English factory.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned two main streams of
Worcester porcelain manufacture, there is yet another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
firm which was established in 1800 by Thomas
Grainger, nephew to Mr. Chamberlain. The firm
became Grainger, Lee &amp; Co., and afterwards
G. Grainger &amp; Co. We give their marks, together
with the other Worcester marks, to enable our
readers to identify any specimens they may possess.
One of the marks in the Kerr &amp; Binns period
requires explanation. The circle with the letter W
radiating from the centre was especially
designed for solely marking the
productions of the factory made for
the use of Queen Victoria and the
Royal household.</p>

<p>The scent-bottle which we give as
illustration has double sides, the outer
being ornamented with perforated
work, painted and gilt. The neck is
beautifully decorated with flowers on
a yellow ground. It is marked
“Chamberlain’s Worcester.” It is an
elegant piece, and very characteristically
shows, for instance, in the
double sides and perforated work,
the influence of Chinese models. This
specimen is at the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>

</div>

<p>About the time of the Exhibition of 1851 there
was great energy displayed by the Worcester factory.
Especially noticeable were the enamelled vases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
dishes, and ewers. This Worcester enamel is a
variety of Limoges work (the Limoges being on
copper and the Worcester wholly porcelain), which
consists of applying semi-opaque white enamel of
varying strength, produced by superimposing more
or fewer layers in gradation upon a deep rich ground
of blue. These enamels were designed to copy the
fifteenth and sixteenth century work, and succeeded
very well in their object. Later, Worcester essayed
to produce jewelled porcelain, in which Berlin and
Vienna had excelled a century before. It won
especial praise at Paris in the 1867 Exhibition, and
became a great financial success.</p>

<p>Whether it be with the Limoges ivory or with the
newer Japanese designs which entered into the later
Worcester productions, the Royal manufactory of
the “faithful city” has always held its own with the
foreign rivals and competitors at international
exhibitions. At Berlin, Paris, Vienna, at Philadelphia,
at Chicago, the success of modern Worcester
is evidence enough of its vitality.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Old Worcester China.</span></h3>

<p>In the early period a simplicity characterised the
productions. “Mandarin” designs from Chinese
models prevailed. These old Worcester under-glaze
blue pieces have a tone unlike any other English
factory, and more nearly approach the Oriental
quality of depth. Blue and white dishes with
pierced borders, and open basket-work dishes were
a feature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p>Transfer printing <i>over</i> the glaze is one of the
characteristics of the factory.</p>

<p>In the second period of Worcester were produced
the elaborate vases in the style of Dresden and of
Sèvres, the finest examples of Worcester.</p>

<p>The third period of over-elaboration in decoration
marks the decline of Worcester.</p>

<p>The porcelain is thin and of very beautiful quality,
having an ivory-like texture. There is a greenish
tint in the paste when subjected to a strong light.</p>

<p>The varieties of bodies used at Worcester from
time to time make any generalisation obviously
impossible. It is only by handling specimens that
the true feeling of Worcester may become instinct in
a collector.</p>

<h3>PLYMOUTH</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of Plymouth stands high in the records
of English china factories. Its porcelain was the
first hard porcelain produced in this country. Other
English chinas melted when placed inside the pieces
in the Plymouth kilns.</p>

<p>Not so well known as Josiah Wedgwood, of
the Staffordshire potteries, William Cookworthy,
of Plymouth, Quaker, chemist, porcelain maker, is
worthy of a niche in the gallery of dead princes of
ceramic art, and his is a name that will never be
forgotten by those who know the history behind
the old Plymouth vases and mugs and statues.</p>

<p>It is true the enterprise was a failure. It only
ran fourteen years, and was, in 1774, transferred to
Bristol. It is true that Lord Camelford, one of
his partners, laments the three thousand pounds expended
on it. But it is more than true that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
results of William Cookworthy’s efforts were no
failure.</p>

<p>The brief life history of the Quaker dreamer (we
know he must have been a dreamer, for he translated
some of Swedenborg’s works into English) is remarkable.
At the age of fourteen, the eldest of a
family of six fatherless children, he tramped from
Plymouth up to London and commenced his
apprenticeship to a chemist. His mother battled
on, eking out her slender means by dressmaking.
Later on, when William Cookworthy came home,
his mother lived under his roof and became a leading
favourite with the great people he knew. The poor
Devon lad who wearily tramped to London over
down and dale, dreaming golden dreams, came home
to entertain Dr. Wolcot, the famous “Peter Pindar”
of vitriolic pen, Sir Joseph Banks, Captain Cook, and
the fighting Earl St. Vincent, who remarked, “whoever
was in Mr. Cookworthy’s company was the
wiser and better for having been in it”; while
Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone Lighthouse,
was an inmate of his house during the erection
of the lighthouse.</p>

<p>In an early letter of Cookworthy’s we find him
speaking of a certain unnamed, strange individual
who came to him with some china earth. “’Twas
found in the back of Virginia, where he was in quest
of mines; and having read Duhalde, discovered
both the petuntse and kaolin. ’Tis the latter earth
he says, is the essential thing towards the success
of the manufacture. He is gone for a cargo of it,
having bought the whole country of the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
where it rises.” We hear no more of this mysterious
individual; but we do hear of extensive
and painstaking researches by Cookworthy, till at
length he is rewarded by discovering the very earth
he wanted, in Cornwall, on the estate of Lord
Camelford.</p>

<p>He established himself at Coxside, at the extreme
angle which juts into the water at Sutton Pool. The
buildings subsequently became a shipwright’s yard,
and even then bore the name China House. We
wonder, do they exist now?</p>

<p>The early examples of Plymouth are clumsy,
sometimes very coarse and rough. Experience was
wanting in firing. Most of the pieces were disfigured
by fire-cracks. Of those decorated in blue the
colour had run into the glazing. But Cookworthy
did one thing—he was the first to produce cobalt blue
direct from the ore.</p>

<p>The white ware of Plymouth, in which is introduced
as ornament shells and seaweed and coral,
is very artistic, and is one of the features of
Plymouth, although none of this ware is marked.
They mostly consist of salt-cellars, pickle-cups, and
what would now be used to put roses in. The
salt-cellar we illustrate is one of a pair in the Bethnal
Green Museum; it has a plain, white body and cloudy
glaze, and is unmarked. Similar shapes are believed
to have been made at Bow. We reproduce a dainty
piece, a shell dish of beautiful design, and ask—was
Cookworthy a failure?</p>

<p>During the latter part of the fourteen years that
Plymouth produced her china, Cookworthy, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
nearing his seventieth year, thought to emulate
Sèvres and Dresden, and employed several artists
for decoration. He engaged the services of a
French artist named Soqui from Sèvres, and he
and Henry Bone, of Plymouth—one of his own
apprentices—produced some finely-painted birds and
flowers.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>WHITE PORCELAIN DISH—PLYMOUTH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The mark of the Plymouth china is blue on the
early clumsy pieces, and later was neatly drawn
in red, sometimes blue. It is the chemical symbol
for tin, being doubtless adopted by Cookworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
to denote that his materials came from the tin
district. It is like the figure four, with a little
curved loop at the beginning.</p>

<p>We reproduce a fine specimen of a splendid vase,
hexagonal shape, sixteen inches high, in the
possession of the Fry family at Bristol. It is richly
decorated with festoons of finely modelled raised
flowers, with painted butterflies and borders. This
was the forerunner of the exquisite Bristol vase
made by the firm which bought Cookworthy’s
life secrets.</p>

<h3>BRISTOL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> several centuries earthenware was made at
Bristol, and a very fair quality of blue delft was produced
there, but it is not of the old potteries of
Bristol that we shall speak, but of the manufacture
which was transplanted from Plymouth to Bristol.
We have related the struggles of William Cookworthy
to establish Plymouth porcelain. The strenuous
efforts to perfect the china were carried on by Richard
Champion, of Bristol, merchant, who bought Cookworthy’s
patent, and established the manufactory
of hard porcelain at Bristol. Champion had, it
appears, been associated with Cookworthy as partner
when the works were at Plymouth.</p>

<p>In 1775, when Champion presented a petition to
the House of Commons to be granted the patent
right for a further period of fourteen years to himself,
he was vigorously opposed by Josiah Wedgwood,
who represented that by granting a patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
to Champion, it would be detrimental to trade and
injurious to the public, urging, among other
grounds, that “the use of the natural productions
of the soil ought to be the right of all.” Wedgwood
presented a memorial to Parliament, and a fierce
controversy ensued. “Much might be said on both
sides,” as Sir Roger De Coverley observes, and much
<i>was</i> said on both sides.</p>

<p>At first blush it seems hard that Cookworthy and
Champion, who found the earth and worked hard
at developing the manufactory in the West, should
have no protection given to their secret. But Wedgwood,
who speaks with authority, urged that when
he invented his Queen’s Ware he did not apply for a
patent, which would have limited its public utility.
“Instead of one hundred manufactories of Queen’s
Ware, there would have been one; and instead of an
exportation to all quarters of the world, a few pretty
things would have been made for the amusement
of the people of fashion in England.”</p>

<p>Without going further into the details of a controversy
which trenches upon questions of political
economy two facts stand out, and the reader can
judge of them as he will. The patent was granted
by Parliament to Richard Champion, who was
subsequently ruined, and left England to die in
South Carolina; and secondly, hard paste was made
at Plymouth and Bristol (never before or since in
England), while the manufacture of the less difficult
soft-paste porcelain and of pottery was carried on
by the Staffordshire factories and Wedgwood.</p>

<div class="figcenter w375"><a id="img_098"></a>
<img src="images/plate_013.jpg" width="375" height="738" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BRISTOL VASE AND COVER.</p>

<p><i>At the Victoria and Albert Museum.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>During the struggle between Wedgwood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
Champion one curious incident occurred. When the
Bill was before the House of Lords for discussion,
one of Champion’s witnesses left London for Bristol
without permission. As it was necessary to bring
him back at once, as the end of the session was at
hand, he was recalled by an “express,” which travelled
the 240 miles to Bristol in twenty-seven hours!</p>

<p>In 1775 was passed (15 George III., cap 52) “an
Act for enlarging the term of Letters Patent granted
by his present Majesty to William Cookworthy, of
Plymouth, Chymist, for the sole use and exercise of a
discovery of certain materials for making Porcelain,
in order to enable Richard Champion, of Bristol,
merchant (to whom the said Letters Patent have
been assigned), to carry the said discovery into
effectual execution for the benefit of the public.”</p>

<p>So we shortly find the Bristol factory in full
swing. The stock of Plymouth, and the tried
workmen, were transferred to Bristol. First of all,
attention was paid to common blue and white ware
as likely to demand a ready sale, and to be profitable.
As in the case of Worcester and other factories,
Champion took Oriental models, and some of his
ware is confounded with other makers who used
the same models. The blue was of good colour, and
dinner, tea, and coffee services, as well as jugs and
mugs, were turned out, sometimes marked with the
Bristol cross, but oftentimes without any distinguishing
mark at all, to the confoundment of the
latter-day collectors.</p>

<p>Bristol was very successful in imitating the
commoner forms of Chinese ware. We reproduce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
teapot and cup and saucer. It will be observed that
the cup follows the original model, and has no
handle.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/page_100.jpg" width="200" height="537" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>[Bristol Marks]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The usual mark of Bristol was a plain cross, sometimes
in blue, sometimes in
red, and often in neutral tint,
or slatey-grey. The crossed
swords of Dresden, accompanied
by the Bristol cross
and the figures 10, appear on
one specimen.</p>

<p>Some of the following
marks which we give have
been assigned to Bristol.
Figures sometimes occur as
well as the cross; these are
believed to denote the painters
engaged on the piece, and are
often marked in red. On one
known Bristol piece, a date
occurs. But to collectors of
Bristol porcelain there is one
test which also applies in
more marked degree to the
Plymouth ware; this is the
series of spiral ridges which
may often be observed on the surface of the ware
when held in reflected light.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the somewhat heated controversy
between Josiah Wedgwood and Richard
Champion, who had transferred the plant from
Plymouth and had applied for an extension of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
Cookworthy’s patent to himself. Josiah Wedgwood,
we think somewhat unfairly, alleged that both
Plymouth and Bristol factories were still in an
experimental stage; he belittles their art, which
“neither the ingenious discoverer nor the purchaser,
for want, perhaps, of skill and experience in this
particular business, have been able, during the space
of seven years already elapsed, to bring to any useful
degree of perfection.”</p>

<p>This is not the place to enter into the merits of
a dead conflict between Staffordshire and Bristol.
That Bristol was not merely an experimental
factory is more than proved by the specimens which
have come down to us, specimens, be it said, that
are more eagerly sought after than many of Wedgwood’s
productions, since they are of hard porcelain
which Staffordshire never made, and which hard
paste has never again been made in England, either
before or since.</p>

<p>One of the choicest examples of the highest art of
Bristol is preserved in the national collection at the
Victoria and Albert Museum. It is stated to have
been “the best that the manufactory could produce.”
It was made in 1774-5, within a few months of the
establishment of the works at Bristol. This example
is interesting too, as being one of the few examples
of the Bristol works, of which the exact date can
be ascertained.</p>

<p>In the year 1774 Edmund Burke was nominated
for Bristol, the capital and richest city of the west.
A fierce election contest followed, in which Burke
was returned as one of the members. During this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
election he was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, of
Bristol, and it was then that Burke ordered a splendid
set of china from Champion. We reproduce the cup
and saucer of this service. It is profusedly and

<p>Each piece, as will be seen, bears the monogram
of Mrs. Smith, “S. S.” interlaced, formed of wreaths
of roses in pink and gold, and also the arms of the

Recently, at Christie’s Auction Rooms, £168 was
paid for two small cups and a tea tray, and, alas!
Cookworthy and Champion died unsuccessful men.
If they are recognised to-day as martyrs to the
ceramic art, their own generation were somewhat
stiff-necked to their genius and enterprise.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BRISTOL VASE (12<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> IN. HIGH).</p>

<p><i>In the Fry Collection.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The vase which we reproduce shows to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
perfection the manufacturers had reached. Among
the decorators of Bristol was Henry Bone, afterwards
an R.A., and miniature enameller to the Royal
Family. Bone was apprenticed to Champion for
seven years, dating from January, 1772.</p>

<p>This vase, in the possession of the Fry family of
Bristol, is of hexagonal shape and is 12<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> inches in
height. The landscapes are excellently painted, and
it has well-modelled female busts on two of its
sides, from which hang festoons of raised flowers
in white. This vase and the other splendid and
almost priceless vases in the possession of the same
family are not marked. It appears that although
only Champion’s name appears on the documents in
connection with the Bristol factory, he had partners
who assisted him financially, one of whom was
Joseph Fry, whose only return, when the factory was
discontinued, for the money he had sunk into the
concern, was the set of vases now in the hands of his
descendants.</p>

<p>We now come to the last act of Bristol. Wedgwood
writes to Bentley in a letter, dated August 24,
1778, concerning Champion’s failure: “Poor Champion,
you may have heard, is quite demolished; it
was never likely to be otherwise, as he had neither
professional knowledge, sufficient capital, nor scarcely
any real acquaintance with the materials he was
working upon. I suppose we might buy some
<i>Growan Stone</i> and <i>Growan Clay</i> now upon easy
terms, for they have prepared a large quantity this
last year.”</p>

<p>His patent right was sold by Champion to a
company of Staffordshire potters who continued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
manufacture at New Hall for some little time until
the ordinary soft paste was allowed to supersede
Champion’s hard paste. So ended the triumphs of
Bristol and Plymouth. It appears that from
November, 1781, to April, 1782, Champion left his
native city to superintend the works of the china
company who had purchased his rights. But Edmund
Burke came to his rescue, and, conjointly with Burke’s
son Richard, Champion was appointed deputy paymaster-general.
Champion occupied official apartments
in Chelsea Hospital. In July a change of
ministry lost him his post, but in April, 1783, he
regained it, only to resign on the fall of the famous
Coalition Ministry in January, 1784. In October,
1784, he left England for South Carolina, where he
became a planter. Seven years after leaving England
he died of fever, and lies buried in the New
World.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be said—his fate was the fate
of so many enthusiasts and workers in the field of
art. Nobody has ever unveiled a monument to
Champion’s memory or to Cookworthy’s memory.
Nobody has designed a stained-glass window to
record their ceramic triumphs.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Their monument—and
it is a lasting one—lies on the china shelf;
the votaries of Plymouth and of Bristol porcelain
need no spark to quicken their fire.</p>

<p>We know Browning’s “Waring” and his unfulfilled
promise of greatness, and how the friend who has
lost him, “like a ghost at break of day,” wishes him
back—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span></p>

<p>And the world would call back its neglected and
unrequited men of genius if it could, and herein lies
the principle that makes china command high prices—these
conscience-prickings are the tribute posterity
pays.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Plymouth and Bristol
Porcelain.</span></h3>

<p>Among special features of Plymouth and Bristol
china, spiral ridges are to be seen, though often barely
noticeable, running from the base transversely around
the body of piece, more noticeable in basins and teapots,
at an angle of 45°. The china of these factories
is often untrue owing to imperfect firing, and is frequently
cracked at base. The Bristol decorators had
a partiality for wreaths and festoons of laurel in green,
interspersed with detached bouquets of flowers. The
Bristol glaze is rich and creamy white, and upon examination
a series of minute depressions, somewhat
similar to the bubbles on Oriental glaze, may be
discovered.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE LOWESTOFT FACTORY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have dealt with Worcester and with Derby, with
Chelsea and with Bow. Of the latter, we told of the
difficulty of determining the marks, and of accurately
naming the china; but what are we to think of a
factory, which we may term the “Mrs. Harris” among
china factories, inasmuch as some people with no less
scepticism than Sairey Gamp’s friend, believe it did
not exist at all. The legends of Lowestoft are many
and varied, but we think we shall succeed in presenting
some sort of rational account of the factory to our
readers, which may dispel many notions, perhaps
wrongly, held by those to whom “Lowestoft” is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
myth and the collecting of it a snare and a
delusion.</p>

<div class="figcenter w425">
<img src="images/page_114.jpg" width="425" height="432" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BLUE AND WHITE DELFT MARRIAGE PLATE, WITH INSCRIPTION.</p>

<p>(Dated 1755.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is stated that a Dutch sailor, wrecked on the
coast, in return for the hospitality of a gentleman who
brought him to his house, was instrumental in pointing
out the value of the white earth which he discovered
on the gentleman’s estate. It is certain that
the sand on the coast of Suffolk at Lowestoft is of
great purity, as compared with that of other parts of
the country, and, when the Lowestoft works were
closed, the Worcester factory availed themselves of it
in making their best porcelain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>There are certain plates of reputed Lowestoft
manufacture, dated 1752 and thereabouts, bearing
the names of Quinton, of Yarmouth, Parrish, of Norwich,
and other local families. These plates are of
earthenware body, with coarse decorations in blue,
and having a yellow rim. They were made to celebrate
the marriage of the persons named on them.
In the one we reproduce, specially photographed for
this volume, the inscription runs: “Henrÿ and Marÿ
Qu̓inton, Yarmou̓th, nor f f: olk. 1755.” This lettering,
with the two dots over the letters y, and the peculiar
placing of the commas over the letters u, is conclusive
evidence that it was written by a foreigner, and presumably
plates such as these were made in Holland
to order of some shipmaster.</p>

<p>One of the owners of the original factory was
Robert Browne, who died in 1771, when the management
was undertaken by his son—also Robert Browne—who
made great experiments in pastes. There is
a story of how Robert Browne the second paid a visit
to London disguised as a workman, and by secreting
himself in a barrel, was enabled to watch the mixing
of the ingredients forming the paste of Chelsea or of
Bow.</p>

<p>The presence of coats of arms upon genuine known
pieces of Lowestoft may have caused some confusion,
which has continued to the present day. At the end
of the last century a great deal of Oriental china was
made having coats of arms of English families upon
it. Although Lowestoft bore no resemblance in its
body to Oriental ware, people came to suppose that,
in some way or another, the ware was brought in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
unfinished state from the East, and then decorated
and re-fired at Lowestoft. With the exception of
Plymouth and Bristol, Lowestoft is the only factory
in England which is credited with producing the true
hard-paste porcelain, as made in the East; all other
old English chinas are of soft paste, and a great deal
of our wares are earthenware, for instance, Wedgwood.
But the claim that Lowestoft made hard paste has
never been substantiated by facts.</p>

<p>Lowestoft may be divided into two parts, the first
dealing with the early period when blue and white ware
was made, and the second period, when a finer and
higher class of goods, with heraldic designs and floral
intricacies, were introduced. At one period of its
history the paste of Lowestoft appears to have been
harder than that of Bow or Chelsea. Roughly, just
a half of a century saw the rise and fall of Lowestoft.
It was established from 1756, and in 1802 the factory
had ceased.</p>

<p>Many families in the Eastern Counties to this day
possess specimens of the Lowestoft china with names
and dates painted on them. This china with names
or initials upon it, or bearing a date, in addition to its
personal value is of historic interest in determining
periods of manufacture. We give a highly interesting
and very rare pair of dated cups and saucers, with
unusual decorations, vine leaves in gold, clusters of
grapes in red, and tablet in centre with inscription,
“M. and E. Calder, Norwich, 1776,” rich blue glaze
and gold bands.</p>

<p>Among other dated specimens of Lowestoft white
and blue ware is a fine bowl, with Chinese figures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
mandarins painted in blue, and inscribed at the
bottom with the name, “Elizabeth Buckle, 1768.”
This Elizabeth Buckle is known to have been an
eccentric old dame, and the service, of which this
bowl is a remnant, was made for her by her nephew,
Robert Allen. This Allen was one of the worthies of
Lowestoft. In 1819, in his seventy-fourth year, he
executed a design for the East window of the Parish
Church (we know not whether it is still in existence
at Lowestoft). In acknowledgment of this service, a
silver cup was presented to him, with the inscription:
“A token of respect to Mr. Robert Allen from his
fellow-townsmen of Lowestoft, for having, at the
advanced age of seventy-four, gratuitously and
elegantly ornamented the East window of their
Parish Church. Ann. Dom. 1819.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<p>After the closing of the Lowestoft works, Allen put
up a small kiln at his own house, where he carried on
operations on a limited scale. He bought the unfinished
ware from Mr. Brameld, of the Rockingham
factory, and painted it and refired it, selling it himself
afterwards.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">

</div>

<p>We reproduce a design of a mug painted by
Thomas Curtis for his father and mother, whose
names appear on it. It is said that Curtis was formerly
employed at Dresden, and that he was a “silent
partner” in the Lowestoft works. Many other
examples of blue and white exist with dates and
names upon them, and there is more than enough
evidence to show that, short as was the history of the
Lowestoft factory, it did good work.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to give an account of the
wonderful decorative qualities of a great artist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
Lowestoft china, whose works now are worth many
pounds, but whose latter days, when he was blind,
were spent in poverty.</p>

<p>We have dealt with the earlier ware made
there—of the blue and white porcelain and of the
delft ware probably made in Holland; we now
come to the higher and finer products of Lowestoft,
over which so many debates have taken place.
It has been held that this ware was decorated at
Lowestoft, but that it was real Oriental body imported
in its half-finished state from the East, and only
painted and re-fired in this country. However, on
the signed testimony of one of the workmen, it is
positively stated that no Oriental porcelain ever came
into the factory at Lowestoft to be decorated. “No
manufactured articles were brought there to be
painted, and every article painted in the factory had
been previously made there.”</p>

<p>The question, too, of hard paste being made at
Lowestoft is now disproved; among all the recently
discovered fragments is nothing of hard paste.</p>

<p>The theory that porcelain came over from China
through Holland to Lowestoft, if it be examined,
does not hold water. First, it would not have paid,
especially as then a large duty existed on china imported,
whereas Lowestoft china was produced at a
fairly cheap cost, and supplied to the public to compete
with Worcester, and Derby, and the Staffordshire
makers. Again, when the Lowestoft factory broke
up, there would naturally have been a lot of unfinished
Oriental porcelain in its white state, prior to the
decoration, thrown on the market. What became of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
it all in 1802? Nobody ever seems to have seen any
white china bowls, or white tea services, or white
vases.</p>

<p>But there is a certain amount of mystery about
Lowestoft, and a great quantity of ware exists both
in this country and abroad, which is classed as Lowestoft
china, but which is really Oriental porcelain with
British armorial bearings.</p>

<p>In fact, the little factory has provided a considerable
field for speculation as to what it did and
what it did not produce. For so small a factory
there is quite a literature in magazine articles, and
one volume has been written upon it. The factory
started about 1765, and closed down in 1802. When
it closed its kilns and heaps of shards were hurriedly
buried, it extinguished the hope of an art that
promised to be greater. The abandonment of an
art industry always breaks some hearts. There is
just one fleeting glimpse of one of the old painters
when teacups and roses were no longer wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of our readers will look under the
rose and read a story, sad enough, but true of many a
craftsman at the end of the day. One old artist who,
by your leave, ladies, painted red roses and twined
chains of rosy wreaths, who put smiles and sunshine
with his artful brush on to your tea services, had
a very aching heart at the end of the journey. Fate
herself twined a chain of grey roses for him. He
was blind and poor. In his old age, he laboured, a
broken-down old man, in the heat of the sun. A
couple of donkeys given to him out of charity
enabled him to bring water into Lowestoft. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
beggar, he would slake a beggar’s thirst. “Wreaths
of roses”—there is something gruesome in the sound
of the words. Handle your china cups with more
tenderness: human lives have gone to the making of
them. The white-hot furnace and the minute brush-mark
of your rose petal turned a man’s day to dark
night. Roses and wreaths of roses, and behind
them all—tears.</p>

<p><i>In the possession of Mr. Merrington Smith, Lowestoft.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The writer is able to confirm the above statements
respecting Lowestoft by information which has been
courteously supplied by a kinswoman of the celebrated
designer of the bouquets of roses on the Lowestoft
porcelain. The first clay was discovered by Mr.
Luson of Gunter Hall in 1756 (now the estate of
Miss Fowler), who sent a small quantity to London
to ascertain its quality. Upon trial it was found to
be excellent, and Mr. Hewlin Luson procured workmen
and erected a temporary kiln on his estate near
the old Warren Houses on the Dunes north of
Lowestoft. A good deal of jealousy was aroused
and trade rivals attempted to wreck the scheme and
tampered with the workmen engaged. After a
year’s struggle a company was formed who purchased
some houses in Bell Lane, now Crown Street, and
established a factory.</p>

<p>In December, 1902, an interesting discovery was
made on the site of the old Lowestoft factory. The
kiln for drying malt of Messrs. Morse, brewers, is
actually the old kiln in which the Lowestoft ware was
fired, and upon the flooring of this being removed to
make a drain, several moulds and fragments of china
were found. I am especially indebted for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
curious touches of Lowestoft colour and much
information concerning this find to those present
while the digging operations were going on.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This important discovery led to a complete investigation
of the old site, and, largely owing to the
enterprise of Mr. A. Merrington Smith, of Lowestoft,
steps were taken to commence excavations. These
resulted, in July, 1903, in the further find of several
bushels of broken moulds and fragments of china.
We give an illustration of the scene when the moulds
and fragments had been discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span></p>

<p>Among these fragments are some decorated pieces
ready for glazing, which cannot be washed, as the
colours, of course, come off. There are glazed fragments
in blue and other colours. There is quite a
variety of handles for cups, mugs, &amp;c., and there are
cups made without handles. There are some birthday
tablets, and some clay pipes with heraldic devices
made for William Harvey, of Yarmouth. One small
piece, evidently part of the bottom of a cup, has a
crescent marked in blue; but this does not prove
that Lowestoft used the crescent as a mark; in all
probability it is the fragment of some Worcester
piece they had for purposes of copying.</p>

<p>There are also unglazed fragments for basket-work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>

There are ribbed tea-cups and cups with cornflower
decoration. Among other fragments are a great
number of toy teapots and toy cups only an inch or
two in height, decorated in blue. We give an illustration
of this toy ware painted under-glaze in blue.</p>

<p>The bulk of these moulds and fragments are in the
possession of W. Rix Spelman, Esq., of Norwich, and
it is to be hoped that careful study and research will,
by means of these indisputable facts, re-establish the
reputation of Lowestoft—</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp, of Denmark Hill, London, possesses
some of the moulds which were disinterred at the
first discovery on the Lowestoft site. He has had
china made in them and baked, and has presented
the results to the British Museum, where they are
now exhibited. They seem too poorly made to show
to advantage the delicate patterns in relief.</p>

<p>The headpiece (<a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>) shows two sauce-boats,
blue and white, with raised decoration. It will be
seen from the fragment of mould, photographed with
them, how exactly this newly discovered mould helps
to identify the pieces.</p>

<p>Among the fragments is part of a teapot mould,
on which is the date 1761. Chaffers, in his authoritative
work on china, remarks of Lowestoft that some
of the larger pieces bear traces of having been “made
in a mould,” and here, just a hundred years after the
factory ceased, comes corroborative evidence.</p>

<p class="clear">There is an interesting mould for an oval perforated
basket, such as Bow and Chelsea produced,
with diamond spaces to be cut out; and upon one of
the fragments of a mould for a sugar basin appears
the most delicate tracery and exquisite designs in
leaves and scrolls, and prominent among the decoration
is the Japanese chrysanthemum.</p>

<p>All East Anglians and lovers of old Lowestoft
will be pleased at this piece of new evidence in
favour of the theories held concerning the old factory,
whose reputation has been well-nigh blasted by
thousands of spurious imitations made in France—literally
covered by vulgar design and more vulgar
coats of arms.</p>

<p>We are able to reproduce some genuine old Lowestoft.
A remarkable piece is the old mug, about 6 in.
high, depicting an old fishwife with bellows under
her arm, and holding a spit of herrings. This is decorated
in blue and white. On the reverse side of mug
is a fishing boat. At the bottom it bears the name
“John Cooper, 1768.” Under the scroll of the
handle are the letters “R. P.,” probably signifying that
it is the work of Richard Philips, a painter at the
Lowestoft factory. Unfortunately it is damaged, as
will be seen by the illustration, but for all that it is a
specimen of considerable value. The jug we illustrate,
having the “Mandarin” decoration common to
Worcester and Bristol, is a fine example of Lowestoft
under-glaze blue painting. It bears the figure 5 upon
it as a mark. It may be observed that many of the
Lowestoft pieces of blue and white bear a striking
resemblance to old Worcester. At first blush one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
inclined to believe them to be Worcester, but the blue
is not quite the Worcester blue, and the glaze tells its
own story. There are pits and dimples, and little
raised surfaces here and there, particularly under the
bases of cups, that are characteristic of Lowestoft.</p>

<p>“A Trifle from Lowestoft,” a legend which is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
familiar one on Lowestoft ware, is an inkstand, with
floral design in that shade of red peculiar to Lowestoft
but so difficult to describe in words. The
decoration on this piece is especially characteristic of
the factory, and we ask readers to make a note of it.</p>

</div>

<p>There are certain marks on undoubted Lowestoft
pieces which the writer has examined. The letter
“R,” which might be the signature of Redgrave the
painter. On another piece the letter “H” appears
under the rim, which may stand for Hughes. The
letters “R. P.” on the mug we illustrate (<a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>) may
equally stand for Richard Powles or Richard Philips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
On one piece two L’s appear back to back (<img src="images/page_130a.jpg" width="20" alt="Reversed L L" />). Is
this Luson, Lowestoft? While on other pieces
appear the mark <img src="images/page_130b.jpg" width="20" alt="X with dots above and to right" /> in red and in blue.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Lowestoft China.</span></h3>

<p>The china is soft paste, and is often very badly
potted. The blue is inclined to run. There is a
gritty appearance in places on the glaze, which is
spotted as if by sand. In some of the blue decorated
pieces, where a flight of birds is introduced, the
crescent moon (like the Worcester crescent mark)
has been put in almost as a challenge to Worcester.
One especial feature is the green hue of the glaze
settled under the rims of saucers and basins and cups.
The paste often has little bumps on it, and a mound
in the centre of base under rim. Roses, set back to
back, appear on Lowestoft pieces. The red of Lowestoft
is of a peculiar quality, approaching puce in
some specimens, and varying from mauve pink to
carmine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Coalport porcelain manufactured in
Shropshire on the banks of the Severn is worth the
telling, and those readers who are possessed of
specimens of the older ware issuing from this factory
will be glad to hear of its first beginnings.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the other great manufactories,
Coalport, we are happy to say, is still in existence.
Bow and Chelsea, Nantgarw and Swansea, Bristol
and Plymouth have disappeared. The potter’s wheel
is silent, and the brush of the artist has been laid
aside for ever. Long since the potters have turned
into clay themselves. At Bow, where the exquisite
ware was produced on the banks of the Lea (“New
Canton,” as the manufactory styled itself), a match
factory stands on the old foundation. Instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
delicate and fragile cupids they now make matches,
but of the kind more associated with Lucifer than
with Cupid.</p>

<p>With Derby and with Worcester, Coalport can
boast that it was established in the middle of the
eighteenth century. Indeed, there is evidence that
the Salopian china made in Colebrookdale is taken
from the same beds of clay which fifteen hundred
years ago supplied the Romans with material for
their white ware, for their jugs, their mortaria, and
their bowls, which are constantly being unearthed
at various spots in the valley of the Severn.</p>

<p>The site of the first works was at Caughley, where
a small pottery was begun about 1754. Early in its
history the names of Brown, Gallimore, and Turner
occur. In my “Chat” on the great Worcester
factory I showed that Dr. Wall was the leading spirit
who infused life into the concern, and it would appear
that Thomas Turner was in some measure induced
to emulate him, and it is seen on comparison that
the early examples of Caughley were very similar to
those of contemporary Worcester. The patterns
were principally confined to blue flowers and
decorations on a white ground. From 1756 to 1776
the manufactory attained a great excellence. There
exists a mug bearing the date 1776, and the name
“Francis Benbow.” There is a nautical ring about
the name. One recollects Admiral Benbow and his
gallant deeds; our Francis Benbow was a bargeman,
for whom the mug was made, but his name will go
down to posterity on this Caughley mug, as it is the
most perfect specimen of its kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span></p>

<p>We give a reproduction of this mug, and readers
will observe the anchor marked over the name, and
we would call especial attention to the nature of the
decoration upon the mug. Dated chinas of old
manufacture are specimens very worthy of notice, as
they are much sought after, and in many cases are
being reproduced with the old dates upon them.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">
<img src="images/page_137.jpg" width="250" height="355" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CAUGHLEY. OLD BLUE MUG.</p>

<p>(Inscribed and Dated 1776.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The excellence of Turner’s porcelain and the
invention of the beautiful dark blue of the Caughley
china, attributed to him, brought the factory into
great prominence. But great secrecy was employed
in its manufacture, and the place hidden away in the
hills was an ideal spot for a manufactory wishing to
be self-contained and free from prying strangers.
In 1780 was produced the celebrated “Willow
Pattern,” which is in demand even at the present
day, and has been copied by all the other manufactories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
The “Blue Dragon,” another favourite
pattern, originated at Caughley, and it was here
that the first blue-printed table service was made in
England. It was made for Thomas Whitmore, Esq.,
of Apley Park, near Bridgnorth, the pattern was
called the “Nankin.” It is interesting to note that
Thomas Minton, of Stoke, assisted in the completion
of this service, being articled as an engraver there.</p>

<p>Until the end of 1790 Messrs. Chamberlain, of
Worcester, had their porcelain in the white from
Thomas Turner, of Caughley. As an instance of
the great secrecy employed by Turner, we may say
that he used to mix all the bodies himself, but afterwards
instructed his sister how to do it. It may
add an additional zest to your old white and blue
Caughley ware to know that a woman who could
keep a secret was intimately associated with its
manufacture.</p>

<p>In 1780 Turner, who had paid a visit to France to
study the foreign methods, brought back with him a
number of skilled artists and workmen. About this
time, too, Mr. John Rose, who had learned the art of
pottery under Turner, left him to establish a factory
of his own at Jackfield. Jackfield, it may be noticed
in passing, is one of the oldest potteries in the
country. As early as 1560 entries occur in the
parish registers of Stoke-upon-Trent of potters
“from Jackfield.” In a disused coal mine here, some
years ago, a brown mug was found which bore the
date 1634. Jackfield was noted for some of its black
decanters of superior glaze, and up to quite a modern
date made a yellow glazed earthenware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, the competition between Mr. Rose and
the old Caughley works became so great that the
old factory was swallowed up by the new one, and
Coalport became the headquarters and the name of
the firm became John Rose and Company, Mr.
Turner withdrawing from the business.</p>

<p>The exact dates are as follows: Between 1780 to
1790 John Rose established his works at Coalport
(he was only at Jackfield for a few years). He
carried on these and the Caughley, which he purchased
in 1799, up till 1814, when Caughley was
finally discontinued.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">
<img src="images/page_139.jpg" width="350" height="203" alt="Early Marks" />
</div>

<p>All these are very dry facts which you must
master in order to understand the specimens on
your china shelf. There is an additional interest, it
always seems to me, in knowing of the men and
women who gave their lives to the perfection of an
industry. There are in existence portraits of
Thomas Turner and his wife, and we should
particularly like to see the likeness of the lady who
secretly mixed the chinas. Perhaps some of our
readers may come across some family in Shropshire
who may possess them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to marks, unfortunately not all the
specimens of Caughley were marked. The above
are some of the varieties of the crescent occurring
on some of the ware, and show pretty clearly the
transition from a half-moon to the engraved C. The
word “Salopian” is sometimes impressed, and on
one known specimen is the name “Turner.” Various
forms of the letter “S,” sometimes with a cross, are
used.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century the
written name “Coalport” was used, though not
extensively, and another mark, the letters “C. D.,”
standing for Colebrookdale, was also used, but somewhat
sparingly.</p>

<p>In 1820 both Swansea and Nantgarw factories
were incorporated with Coalport, and Messrs.
Billingsley and Walker, well-known names in the
history of English china manufacture, came to
Coalport. In 1820 Mr. Rose received the gold medal
of the Society of Arts for his Felspar porcelain, and
this date is a turning point in the history of Coalport.</p>

<p>At this time Coalport began to establish a reputation
for its excellence, which placed it on a level with
the other great manufactories—a reputation, be it
said, that has increased as time has gone on. We
reproduce a handsome vase of Coalport manufacture,
richly decorated with pink and gold, on a blue
ground. Its elegant form is typical of the ware at
its best period.</p>

<p>At the present moment the productions of Coalport,
both old and modern, are unequalled in their
domain. The old traditions of the firm are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
maintained, and the ware of to-day is of the highest
possible artistic merit and excellence.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">
<img src="images/page_141.jpg" width="250" height="569" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>COALPORT VASE.</p>

</div>

<p>By the kindness of the proprietors of the Coalport
manufactory, we are enabled to give some further
account of the modern ware, and to reproduce illustrations
of the later marks used and of the sumptuous
plates turned out at the present day from Iron
Bridge, in Shropshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1820, the first year of the reign of
George IV., Mr. John Rose obtained the gold medal
of the Society of Arts for his “improved glaze for
porcelain.” At this time a mark was adopted on
some of the ware, “Coalport Improved Felspar
Porcelain,” enclosed in a wreath of laurel. Surrounding
the wreath are the words “Patronised by the
Society of Arts.” The name “I. Rose
and Co.” is marked underneath. If
any of our readers have any porcelain
having this mark, they will notice how
good is the paste and how excellent
the glaze.</p>

<div class="figcenter w150">
<img src="images/page_142.jpg" width="150" height="489" alt="Coalport Marks" />
</div>

<p>Just prior to the mark above alluded
to, the word Coalport was used and
sometimes the letters “C. D.”—standing
for Cole-Brook-Dale. Other
marks of a later date are a monogram
formed of the letters “C. B. D.,” and
the same enclosed in a circle with the
word “Daniell, London,” an eminent
firm acting as agents and connected
with the sale of the ware in London.
This firm had depôts in Bond Street
and in Wigmore Street, and there is
in the national collection a plate with <i>bleu-de-roi</i>
ground, enriched with gilding, one of a service
executed by command of Her Majesty the late
Queen Victoria for presentation to the Emperor of
Russia. This service was exhibited at the Great
Exhibition of 1851. In the centre of the plate is
painted the Order of St. Andrew, while the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
is ornamented with Russian orders painted on ivory-coloured
ground in six compartments.</p>

<p>We now come to a very curious mark which may
have puzzled some of our readers,
but which is easily explained. It
is a scroll somewhat like that which
stands for the word “and”—&amp;.
Within its curves appear the three
letters “C. S. N.” Upon examination
it will be found that the aforesaid
curves really make two letters,
viz., “C. and S.,” which stand for
<i>Coalport</i> and <i>Salopian</i>, while the
other three letters stand for <i>Caughley</i>,
<i>Swansea</i>, and <i>Nantgarw</i>—the whole
emblematical of the development of

<p>LATEST
COALPORT
MARKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It must be observed that much of
the earlier Coalport was unmarked,
while—we blush to have to print
it—some of the ware imitated the double “L” mark
of Sèvres, and the “C” and anchor of Chelsea and the
crossed swords of Dresden, so successfully as to
delude the unwary collector. The celebrated egg-shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
porcelain of Coalport ranks among the most
marvellous china ever produced in this country. It is
rarely marked with any letters or signs, but it carries
upon it a signature of perfection of manufacture and
exquisite symmetry of design such as no other factory
dared emulate, and no other factory has since approached.
These tiny cups and saucers (the cup
follows Chinese models by having no handle) are gems
of ceramic art, and happy is the collector who can
number one or two good specimens in his china
cabinet.</p>

<p>The well-known “Willow Pattern,” first manufactured
here, is from a Chinese model. It is still
manufactured by the Coalport Company, and is one
of their stock patterns. It appears on a list of
some forty patterns, which can be and are manufactured
without the use of lead.</p>

<p>Readers may find the words “Leadless Glaze” on
some of their quite recent purchases in modern
china. The terrible effects of lead on the workpeople
in china factories is a subject which has received the
attention of Parliament (see <a href="#Page_xxiii">p. xxiii</a>). But in passing it
is highly satisfactory to find that the Coalport
Company turn out, without special order, forty
patterns entirely “leadless.” Any one who is
specially desirous of having “leadless glaze” on
any other of the Coalport ware may do so by
ordering it.</p>

<p>To come down to the very latest marks, there are
three that have been in use. The first in the seventies,
the second in the eighties, and the last, now solely
used, was adopted some twelve years ago with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
addition of the word “England” to meet the requirements
of the American Tariff Act, which made it
compulsory for foreign goods to be thus stamped.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>OLD COALPORT VASE.</p>

<p>(Decorated in pink and white. Marked CBD.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first has the words “Salopian, Coalport,” in
a scroll, which has within it the old mark of Caughley,
a crescent with “A.D. 1750” beneath it, and in
addition the letters “C. S. N.,” in scroll as before
alluded to, and having the date, “A.D. 1790,” underneath.
This is a very complicated mark, and is not
generally known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span></p>

<p>The second is a crown with the word “Coalport,
A.D. 1750,” underneath. The third is the same with
the addition of the word “England.”</p>

<p>In conclusion we may quote the fact, to give our
readers some idea of the quality of the ware now being
exported by the Coalport Company, that some of the
dinner ware sent to America costs no less a sum than
£5 per plate, while there are even more sumptuous
and magnificent specimens of their manufacture
which cost £15 each plate. One of these, amongst
others, is a plate with a coloured design painted
after Sir Joshua Reynolds’ celebrated portrait of Mrs.
Robinson.</p>

<p class="ph2">SPODE AND HIS SUCCESSORS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chain of potters is complete from the day on
which Josiah Spode was apprenticed to Whieldon in
1749. The entry in the old account book runs:
“1749, April 9th. Hired Siah Spode, to give him
from this time to Martelmas next 2s. 3d., or 2s. 6d. if
he deserves it, 2nd year 2s. 9d., 3rd year 3s. 3d.” The
successors to Spode, Messrs. Copeland, have done
much to develop the manufacture of English porcelain
in the nineteenth century, and at the present
day they are producing china of the highest excellence.</p>

<p>The first Josiah Spode established a factory at
Stoke-upon-Trent about 1770. Some of his earliest
productions bear the name “Spode” impressed in the
paste. Those of my readers who have blue willow-pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
plates with this mark upon them are the
possessors of some of the first plates of that pattern
made. About 1780 the willow pattern was introduced
by Turner at Caughley, and very shortly afterwards,
in 1784, Josiah Spode was turning out at Stoke
his blue printed plates. Some of his china is printed
in black, and pieces of this black printing are much
sought after by collectors, but they must bear the
word “Spode” impressed on them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>OLD SPODE PASTILLE-BURNER.</p>

<p>(Red body with black ornaments in relief.)</p>

<p><i>At Victoria and Albert Museum.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The vase which we reproduce from the collection at
the Victoria and Albert Museum is a pastille-burner
having perforated cover; it is mounted on tripod
stand formed by three dolphins on triangular base;
it is red in colour and ornamented in black in relief.
It has the impressed mark “Spode,” and is earthenware,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
but we give it here on account of its fine
form.</p>

<p>On the death of old Josiah Spode, in 1798, his son
Josiah continued the business, and commenced the
manufacture of porcelain, which he improved by the
addition of bone-ash and of felspar. He died in 1827,
and was succeeded by his cousin, Josiah Spode.
This third Josiah Spode died a few years afterwards,
at which date the name Spode practically disappears
from the firm.</p>

<p>Josiah Spode the second was the most successful
potter of his day. It is pleasing to be able to record
that he acquired a considerable fortune—a lot not
often within the reach of potters, successful or
otherwise.</p>

<p>About the year 1805 he introduced a fine ware
which he termed opaque porcelain. This ware became
very popular and was of excellent manufacture.
While Nelson was fighting the French at Trafalgar,
and breaking their naval pretensions, Josiah Spode
was inflicting a commercial blow upon that unhappy
country. Spode—and in his wake came other
Staffordshire manufacturers—inundated France and
other countries on the Continent with this new stone
china of his, which entirely superseded their fayence.
This injury was a very real one to the poor potters of
France, inasmuch as a great number of them had to
abandon the manufacture.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to the impressed mark
<b>Spode</b> or SPODE. On some of the finer pieces the
name is painted in red, and sometimes it is written in
gold, as in our third mark in an angular hand, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
upwards. The stamped mark usually in red,
“Spode’s New Fayence” and “Spode Stone China,”
appears on the ironstone ware. Oftentimes the mark
is not stamped on the middle of the plate underneath,
but at the side, while sometimes the name is both
stamped and impressed. Besides
the marks we give there
are more than half a dozen
other forms used by the factory,
but all of them containing the
word “Spode,” and therefore not
presenting difficulties to the
collector.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>SOME SPODE MARKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of three marked Spode plates
in possession of the writer,
of typical Spode decoration,
which was largely influenced by
Japanese art, we give two as a
headpiece. It will be observed
that the left-hand plate in the
headpiece, which has a vivid
blue background, is fretted with
a geometric pattern as a design.
This is intended to represent
ice, and the may-flowers of the
covering decoration are intended
to convey, by the Chinese artist who invented
it, the symbolic meaning of young love being chilled
by adversity. The other plate in the same illustration
is of a brilliant canary-coloured ground,
covered with a gossamer-like network of cobwebs,
above which bird and flowers are painted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span></p>

<p>The third plate shows very strongly the influence of
the East in its method of decoration; but instead of
pagoda and delicate curves, the English artist has
almost brutally placed a piece of European architecture
on the other half of the plate, which by its
incongruity mars the remainder.</p>

</div>

<p>We must turn aside from Spode, and introduce our
readers to his successors, the Copelands. One word
in passing. Those who have specimens of Spode
ware will do well to remember that his was a great
factory, not so well known as Derby and Worcester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
but a formidable rival of theirs. Not many months
ago at Christie’s a pair of Spode vases, square shaped,
decorated with landscapes, birds and
flowers in the Chinese style, forty-two
inches, brought £21.</p>

<p>MARKS OF
MESSRS. COPELAND.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The list of marks used by Messrs.
Copeland will show at a glance the
changes in the title of the firm. In
1833 the firm became Copeland, late
Spode, and the china was marked
accordingly.</p>

<p>There are a good many other
marks besides those we give, but all
are more or less similar, with slight
variation to those we produce. A
word of explanation is necessary as
to the mark “C. and G.” This is frequently
accompanied by the words,
“New Blanche,” “Royal Opal,”
“Saxon Blue,” or “New Japan Stone,”
according to the composition or
decoration of the ware.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SPODE WILLOW PATTERN PLATES.</p>

<p><i>By courtesy of Messrs. W. T. Copeland &amp; Sons.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>About the date of the International
Exhibition of 1861, many
purely English novelties were attempted.
Mistletoe, holly, and simple
popular designs were then in favour
and were produced. Nobody could
possibly mistake the homely robin or
the holly-wreath decoration for that
of any other country than ours. There is a suggestion
of roast beef and plum-pudding and Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
fare. All purely English art is homely, whether it
be the Staffordshire potter’s farmyard quadrupeds
that adorn the cottage mantelshelf, or the old blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
dinner services of our great grandmothers. It is a
debatable point if that is the highest art, but there it
is. Ruskin would have had some hard things to say
about it, and maybe William Morris preferred the
potsherd of an Italian shepherd. The fact remains
that it is <i>our</i> art, and whatever we may in our innermost
hearts wish it to be, we have to take it and study
it as we find it.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of these later and more
modern chinas we may say, in passing, that the firm
of Messrs. Copeland have done more than any other
existing firm to maintain the traditions of a great
factory. They have adhered to early designs, and
all through the nineteenth century their record has
been an exceedingly high one. It was Messrs. Copeland
who first introduced, in 1845, their Parian ware,
a very near approach to true porcelain. The writer
has seen a Copeland and Garrett plate which in
appearance was fully equal to Derby at its best
period.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Spode China.</span></h3>

<p>Spode ware is well potted, and feels to the touch
like turned ivory. It can readily be distinguished
from any of the glassy porcelains. It is light in
weight. In design it follows Japanese more than
Chinese models. The glaze is very even and smooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of these two factories in Wales is
bound up together. Billingsley, the chief flower-painter
of Derby, was the founder of the little factory
at Nantgarw, a small village a few miles north of
Cardiff.</p>

<p>His was a restless, roving career. In other
“Chats” we have alluded to him. Apprenticed
at Derby under Duesbury, he left there in 1796,
to commence the manufacture of porcelain at
Pinxton. In 1801 we find he had left Pinxton and
was engaged upon the decoration of Staffordshire
porcelain at Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire. He
is next described as “of Torksey,” which is near
Gainsborough. At Worcester he engaged himself
under Messrs. Flight and Barr, and was employed on
flower-painting from 1808 to 1811.</p>

<p>Billingsley was known as “Beeley” at this time.
Monetary difficulties had compelled him to take
precautions against his arrest for debt. About this
time, too, together with his son-in-law, Samuel
Walker, he appears to have visited the Coalport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>

Walker.</p>

<p>Of late, a considerable interest has been shown in
the porcelain of Nantgarw and Swansea. Collectors
have ascribed to it artistic qualities greater than
those of Worcester or Derby. The lovers of
Nantgarw, and those connoisseurs who collect this
and no other porcelain, will not admit that it is
in any way inferior to the greatest factories that
have existed in this country, and compare it to
Sèvres.</p>

<p>Recently at Christie’s Auction Rooms a dessert
service of Nantgarw manufacture brought £128 2s.
Each piece was painted with a bouquet of flowers in
the centre, the borders with raised white scrolls,
painted with birds and flowers. This service consisted
of centre dish, on feet, four square-shaped
dishes, two-leaf shaped dishes, seventeen plates and
two small plates. This works out at nearly £4 15s.
each piece.</p>

<p>At another London auction room, seven Nantgarw
plates, painted with birds and bouquets of flowers
in border, all with impressed mark, in December last
brought under the hammer, £97, which is nearly £14
each plate! After this it is useless to deny that
Nantgarw is a factory which must be reckoned with
from a collector’s point of view.</p>

<p>Great stress has been laid by those who affect
the collecting of Nantgarw on its whiteness and
transparency. By its detractors this is said to be its
fault—that it is too white and too cold to compete
with the older productions of the better-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
factories. Of course only experts come to blows
on this matter. Whether it is too glassy and too
cold, and lacking the mellow warmth of the older
glassy porcelains, matters little to the modest
collector who desires to have Nantgarw represented
in his or her scanty collection.</p>

<p>It may be observed in passing that the distinguishing
feature of Nantgarw is the elaborate painting
of flowers and fruit on the pieces manufactured there.
We reproduce a beautiful Nantgarw dish, marked
“NANTGARW. C. W.,” with pink ground, having
garlands of raised white flowers bound with a knot,
and encircled with richly gilded scrolls. The centre
is white, with a handsome floral piece from the brush
of Billingsley. The roses are exquisitely drawn,
such as no other ceramic artist ever drew them; and
the pear, of a warm, luscious brown, has all the bloom
of the natural fruit upon it.</p>

<p>Mr. Dillwyn, of the Swansea works, has left us
an interesting memorandum concerning the proprietors
of Nantgarw. He says:—</p>

<p>“My friend Sir Joseph Banks informed me that
two persons, named Walker and Beeley, had sent
to Government, from a small manufactory at
Nantgarw (ten or twelve miles north of Cardiff),
a specimen of beautiful china, with a petition for
their patronage, and that, as one of the Board of
Trade, he requested me to examine and report upon
that manufactory. Upon witnessing the firing of a
kiln at Nantgarw, I found much reason for considering
that the body used was too nearly allied to
glass to bear the necessary heat, and observed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
nine-tenths of the articles were either shivered, or
more or less injured in shape by the firing. The
parties, however, succeeded in making me believe
that the defects in their porcelain arose entirely from
imperfections in their small trial-kiln, and I agreed
with them for a removal to the Cambrian Pottery, at
which two new kilns under their direction were
prepared. While endeavouring to strengthen and
improve this beautiful body, I was surprised at
receiving a notice from Messrs. Flight &amp; Barr, of
Worcester, charging the parties calling themselves
Walker and Beeley with having clandestinely left an
engagement at their works, and forbidding me to
employ them.” This was in 1814, and it was in
the same year that Billingsley and Walker entered
the service of Mr. Dillwyn at Swansea and commenced
to make the beautiful china, highly decorated
and of exquisite finish.</p>

<p>In concluding our remarks on Nantgarw we may
observe that this factory was not finally abandoned
till 1820. From 1812 to 1814 is its first period, when
Billingsley and Walker and Young (of whom we
shall have more to say later) were all at Nantgarw.
Its second period is when the trio appear there again
from 1817 to 1819. Billingsley and Walker then
left for Coalport, and Young carried on the works till
their close.</p>

<p>The only marks that appear on the china are
the word “Nantgarw” with the letters “C. W.”
underneath, which in all probability meant China
Works, but which by some collectors are said to
denote the name of the artist. This is impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
in the china. Sometimes the word “Nantgarw” is
found in red, but this must be
regarded with suspicion, as a
great many forgeries have been
perpetrated in this china owing
to its rarity and the favour
which it finds with collectors.</p>

<div class="figcenter w175">
<img src="images/page_171a.jpg" width="175" height="320" alt="Swansea Marks" />
</div>

<p>Swansea has a more extended
history. In the middle of the
eighteenth century a small
manufactory of earthenware existed
here. This gradually grew
into the “Cambrian Pottery,”
which, at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, passed into
the hands of Mr. Lewis Weston Dillwyn, a Fellow of
the Linnæan Society and author of works on
botany.</p>

<div class="figcenter w225">
<img src="images/page_171b.jpg" width="225" height="335" alt="Swansea Marks" />
</div>

<p>Before Mr. Dillwyn’s
day a fine opaque china
was produced at Swansea,
but under his management
and guidance the china
assumed a more artistic
appearance.</p>

<p>W. W. Young, whom
we spoke of as having
come over from Nantgarw,
was especially skilful at
painting flowers and birds,
butterflies and insects, and
sometimes shells. Some of the pieces of Swansea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
bear his name upon them. Young was also employed
by Mr. Dillwyn to illustrate his works on
botany and natural history.</p>

</div>

<p>Besides Young and the two Nantgarw flower
painters and decorators, there was at Swansea
Baxter, who was considered one of the cleverest
painters on china of his day. He came originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
from Worcester and eventually returned there.
Some of the subjects from the canvases of Sir Joshua
Reynolds were successfully copied by him. Baxter
was at Swansea for three years, and while there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
decorated a service with garden scenery in the style
peculiarly his own. There was Morris, a clever
fruit painter, and Beddoes, a noted heraldic painter,
and, above all, Billingsley, the first flower painter
of his day.</p>

<p>Stamped “Dillwyn’s Etruscan Ware.”</p>

<p><i>In Collection of Mr. W. G. Honey.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>About the year 1820 the Swansea factory was
discontinued and the whole of the moulds and
appliances were transferred by Mr. John Rose to
Coalport. Since that date no china has been made
at Swansea. Some of the marks that we give are
of a later date than 1820, and are upon earthenware.</p>

<p>Among the marks of Swansea will be seen the
oblong mark stamped on “Dillwyn’s Etruscan
Ware.” This ware was introduced in 1848, and
was of a fine rich red body. On this was printed,
in black outline, Etruscan figures, borders, and other
details. The general surface was then painted over,
with the exception of the figures and designs within
the black outlines. The result was that the figures
were left the original red of the body and the effect
was extremely good. The illustration we give is of
a specimen in Mr. W. G. Honey’s collection, late at
the Cork Exhibition.</p>

<p>The older pieces stamped with the above-mentioned
mark are sought after. Later the name and
title of the firm changed and passed into the hands
of Messrs. Evans &amp; Co. Besides the manufacture
of white, and blue and white china, they supplied
Ireland and the West of England with agate earthenware,
and a good deal of it found its way to America.
No trade-mark was used by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characteristics of Nantgarw and Swansea
China.</span></h3>

<p><i>Nantgarw</i> porcelain is of very fine texture; it has
a glassy appearance, and when held up to a strong
light, such as an incandescent electric globe, it
exhibits a number of small bubbles, like pin-holes, in
the body. It is inclined to have the glaze cracked
in parts with a network almost like Chinese crackle
ware. Some of the thinner pieces will be found to
be not quite true, being slightly warped or bent,
owing to its uncertainty in the kiln.</p>

<p><i>Swansea</i> china is frequently decorated with birds,
butterflies, and shells, drawn from nature by W. W.
Young. Much of it is of a glassy nature like Nantgarw;
but later the Swansea ware was of a duller,
heavier nature, and having a hard white appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Minton</span>, of Stoke, in Staffordshire, manufacture
pottery, porcelain, and majolica. By this
latter, that massive ware, of bold design and bolder
ornamentation and positive colours, principally blues,
yellows, and greens, Minton’s at the Paris Exhibition
of 1855 created quite a sensation, and won universal
admiration.</p>

<p>Ten years before the commencement of the
nineteenth century Thomas Minton established his
factory at Stoke-upon-Trent. Only earthenware
was manufactured at Stoke Works up till 1798,
chiefly ordinary white ware, ornamented with blue, in
imitation of Nankin china. From about 1799 down
to 1811 a semi-transparent china was also made, but
was abandoned as unprofitable. In 1817 Mr. Minton’s
two sons entered the firm. In 1821 the manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
of china was again resumed; about this time, too, a
very marked improvement was noticeable in Minton’s
printed earthenware; the body was whiter, and the
glaze was more highly finished.</p>

<p>We give the two early marks of the firm down to
1837. These were usually in
blue, and very often had a number
underneath. In these earlier
examples the flowers and other
decorations were painted. They
very shortly became mostly
printed designs, except in elaborate
pieces, and the personal
character of the ordinary china
grew, in consequence, of less
interest.</p>

</div>

<p>Sometimes “M. and C.” (the
C. standing for Company), with
an impressed stamp “BB.” or
“BB. New Stone,” occurs. BB.
signifies “best body.” A design
of passion-flowers printed in blue
is a favourite subject.</p>

<p>In 1836 Mr. John Boyle was
admitted a partner, on the death
of Thomas Minton; the firm became then Minton
and Boyle, and the marks were accordingly changed.
After continuing for five years Mr. Boyle went over
to the Wedgwoods.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Minton was subsequently joined by his
nephews, M. D. Hollins and Colin Minton-Campbell.
The second Minton seems to have been of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
business ability. In his father’s day fifty hands
were employed at Stoke, but in his time the factory
employed no less than 1,500. The various branches
he developed were earthenware, and ordinary soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
porcelain, hard porcelain, parian, coloured and enamelled
tiles, mosaics, Della Robbia ware, majolica,
and Palissy ware.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the accompanying illustrations
how highly decorative Minton porcelain is. The vase
we reproduce was one of the most admired specimens
of china in the Paris Exhibition of 1867.</p>

<p>What is known as the ermine mark (the dark
trefoil with the three dots), either
indented or painted in gold and
colours, has been used on porcelain
since 1851, and since 1865
the word “<span class="smcap">Minton</span>,” impressed,
has been used for both china and
earthenware.</p>

<p>In 1868 the globe, with the
word “<span class="smcap">Minton</span>” across it, was
first used, and all the firm’s works
subsequent to that date are so
stamped. In 1872 the design was
registered, and frequently a rhomboidal
stamp occurs either without
or in addition to the globe
mark, which has the letter R in the centre, denoting
that the particular pattern of china is “Registered”
as a design. This rhomboidal mark occurs on chinas
other than Minton’s, and is a feature of modern china.</p>

<p>“Minton, Hollins &amp; Co.” are a firm at Stoke largely
engaged in manufacturing encaustic and majolica
tiles. They are an offshoot of the main branch.</p>

<p>The illustration we give of the lion ewer is a fine
example of Minton’s reproduction of the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
Henri II. faïence. This wonderful ware is of distinct
character and ornamentation, differing from every
other kind of pottery. It was made at Oiron, in
France, from 1524 to 1550. There are less than one
hundred known pieces. Five pieces are in the
Victoria and Albert Museum. Two are in the Louvre.
Some of the pieces are valued at over £3,000 each.
Who shall say that there is no romance in old china
and pottery when vases and ewers, tazzas and salt-cellars,
have pedigrees as long as a race-horse’s, and
whose whereabouts are as well known as that of a
reigning prince?</p>

<p>The plaque of painted
majolica is a good specimen
of what Minton can do. It was
made about 1865, as was the lion
ewer alluded to on <a href="#Page_184">p. 184</a>, and the
candelabrum is also of the same
period. There is a fine fountain
executed in Minton majolica; it
is 36 feet high and 39 feet in
diameter. At the summit there
is a group, larger than life size,
of St. George and the Dragon.
It was one of the features of
the International Exhibition of
1862; it now embellishes the
scanty grass plot in front of the
Bethnal Green Museum.</p>

<p>Some fine old Sèvres pieces have been copied by
Mintons, and great fidelity has been shown in reproducing
the old ground colours of rose-du-Barri,
gros-bleu, turquoise, and pea-green. Chinese porcelain
has been imitated with especial success. The
most notable artistic achievement is the <i>pâte-sur-pâte</i>
work, by M. Leon Solon. The coloured background
is worked upon in white clay, and the delicate
modelling of figures in this material is of great artistic
beauty. Each result is a personal creation of the
potter which cannot be duplicated.</p>

<p class="ph2">OLD ENGLISH EARTHENWARE<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> requires a word of apology for including the
following “Chats” on earthenware in a volume bearing
the title “Chats on English China,” but as the
chief end of this little volume is to render to the
beginner such aid as may be useful in the determination
of the various classes of china, it was
thought desirable in his interest to treat somewhat
generally of earthenware in this and the succeeding
chapters.</p>

<p>Earthenware suggests pots and pans, and the word
is redolent of kitchen smells, but a Wedgwood teapot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
or a Toby jug, though earthenware they be, are
worth the having. Pottery is the poor relation of
porcelain. The one comes in silks and satins, in
purple and fine linen; the other in cotton gown, like
Phyllis at the fair.</p>

<p>The following remarks may lend a zest to dusting
days, and, mayhap, the poor relation may be invited
to come down from the top shelf in the kitchen to
occupy a niche in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that what has already been said
on china may have created a taste in the reader for
the inventions of the potter. A blue bowl may
convey a world of meaning, and may be fragrant
with memories of the eighteenth century, if one cares
to peer beneath the surface. To the uninitiated it will
be a blue bowl—and ugly maybe at that. To some
the potter’s art is as dead a thing as was Nature’s
message to Wordsworth’s insensate:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A primrose by a river’s brim</div>
<div class="verse">A yellow primrose was to him,</div>
<div class="verse">And it was nothing more.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That it is not always easy to determine where a
piece of china may have come from we have already
shown, even if it be “A Present from the Crystal
Palace.” The ordinary mind may possibly imagine
some hitherto unknown factory away at Sydenham,
but the legend “Made in Germany” underneath
instantly dispels that illusion.</p>

<p>It is necessary here to state that the world of <i>bric-à-brac</i>
is divided into two parts—earthenware or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
pottery, and china or porcelain. All that is not
earthenware is porcelain, and all that is not porcelain
is earthenware. One may liken it to prose and
poetry; what is not one must be the other, as
Monsieur Jourdain discovered after he had spoken
prose for forty years without knowing it. To continue
the simile, some of Ruskin’s prose writings
approach as near to poetry as do Wedgwood’s finer
wares to porcelain.</p>

<p>Porcelain is produced by the artificial mixture of
certain minerals known by their Chinese names of
<i>kaolin</i> and <i>petuntse</i>, or their English ones of china-clay
and felspar. The former is infusible under the
greatest heat, the latter is not, but unites in a state
of fusion with the china-clay, making a paste or
“body,” which is hard, and, when broken, shows a
smooth, vitreous fracture. Those who have attempted
to mend old china must have noticed how different
the broken surface is from that of pottery with its
rougher edges.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking these “Chats” on earthenware
ought to have appeared at the commencement of the
volume, for earthenware comes first chronologically.
In passing we will glance for a moment as to how
porcelain came into Europe.</p>

<p>Porcelain was first invented by the Chinese some
two centuries before Christ. It reached Europe as
the Eastern civilisation penetrated to the west, and
for hundreds of years vain attempts were made by
potters to reproduce the fineness of porcelain with its
beautiful glaze and hard paste. At Venice, at
Florence, in France, and in Spain, during the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
and seventeenth centuries, an approximate
success had been arrived at; soft paste had been
developed to its furthest limit, but the real ingredients
of the Chinese hard paste were unknown.</p>

<p>Accident, however, completed what centuries of
industry had attempted. From perruque to porcelain
seems a far cry, but the story is worth telling.</p>

<p>John Schnorr, an ironmaster, riding near Aue,
observed that a soft earth adhered strongly to his
horse’s hoofs. Considering that this earth might be
used as a substitute for wheat flour as hair powder,
he carried some away with him, and it was subsequently
sold in large quantities for this purpose
at Dresden, Leipsic, and other places. This <i>kaolin</i>
(the base of hard paste) continued to be known as
“Schnorr’s white earth.”</p>

<p>Johann Friedrich Böttcher, chemist to the Elector
of Saxony and King of Poland, discovered the secret
about 1709. One morning, on taking up his wig, he
noticed it was much heavier than usual. He was
informed by his valet that a new kind of hair-powder
had been used. This was the ironmaster’s white
earth. Böttcher was convinced that he had discovered
at last the base of porcelain.</p>

<p>This was the foundation of the manufacture of
porcelain at Meissen, and the factory then established
has supplied the world with Dresden china ever since.</p>

<p>So great was the secrecy at first, that Böttcher and
his assistants, when Charles XII. of Sweden invaded
Saxony, were removed by the Elector for greater
safety to the castle at Königstein, where they were
practically imprisoned. Even the clay was sealed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
in barrels by dumb persons, and every workman was
required to take a solemn oath not to reveal the
secret. “Be silent unto death” was the motto of the
establishment.</p>

<p>How the method of manufacture and the secrets
of Meissen finally became known to other countries,
and how manufactories came to be set up at Vienna
and Petersburg, is one of the romances of trade.</p>

<p>So much for the early history of porcelain in
Europe. During this period the art of the potter
had not made very great progress in England. These
“Chats” have shown of the heroic attempts to
emulate the success of Meissen, but it was slow,
uphill work to reach the heights of Worcester and of
Derby in porcelain and of Wedgwood in earthenware.</p>

<p>Stoneware mugs were more in accordance with the
taste of our forefathers than pewter pots for drinking
purposes, a comparatively modern prejudice. A
variety of mugs called Longbeards, largely imported
from Low Countries, were in general use during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at inns for
serving all the customers. The name “Bellarmine”
was sarcastically given them in reference to the
cardinal most conspicuous in opposing the Reformed
faith in the Netherlands, the potter representing,
with grotesque art, his Eminence with short stature
and rotund figure.</p>

</div>

<p>It is but a short step from the ware imported from
the Low Countries to the pottery of Staffordshire.
The celebrated pattern of the Toby jug is well known.
Dickens, in “Barnaby Rudge,” makes Gabriel Varden
ask Dolly to “put Toby this way.” Uncle Toby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
himself might have suggested the design, but it is
said to be derived from one Toby Philpot, “a thirsty
old soul as e’er drank a bottle or fathomed a bowl.”
We give, from Mr. W. G. Honey’s collection at Cork,
two fine specimens—one an old Staffordshire jug
(10<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> in. high), representing John Bull, and marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
“I. W.”; the other, the well-known pattern of the
Vicar and Moses (9<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> in. high). This latter is the
work of Ralph Wood, of Burslem, and was frequently
reproduced by later potters. Both these pieces are
blue and white.</p>

<p>Of Josiah Wedgwood, the English Palissy, we
deal in a separate “Chat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span></p>

<p>A whole volume could be written about him and
his work. His busts, magnificently produced in black
basalt, his cameos and gems, with which the name of
Flaxman must be coupled, his white terra-cotta, and
his cream-coloured earthenware, known as Queen’s
ware (first made for Queen Charlotte), may be ranked
among the most important factors in the history and
development of the potter’s art in England.</p>

<p>Of the most important of the other Staffordshire
potters, perhaps the name of Spode is the best
known. After 1798, Spode the younger commenced
to make porcelain.</p>

<p>Concerning Liverpool, to which we devote a
separate “Chat,” it seems remarkable to read that in
1754 the making of pottery was the staple manufacture
of the city. “The blue and white earthenware
almost vie with china,” so says an eighteenth-century
journal.</p>

<p>John Sadler conceived the idea of transferring
prints from copper on to pottery, and struck out a
new line in printing on earthenware.</p>

<p>Another factory, called the “Herculaneum Pottery,”
was started on the Mersey side by Messrs. Abbey
and Graham in 1794. The making of china was
started here in 1800.</p>

<p>About the end of the eighteenth century, a potter
named Absolon had works at a place called “The
Ovens” at Yarmouth. The work consisted of
decorating the articles which were manufactured
elsewhere, and very little more is known about it.</p>

<p>At Swansea both pottery and porcelain were
made. In 1750 works were established, and in 1790<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
“Cambrian Pottery” became quite well known. In
the early part of the next century a superior kind of
ware, called “Opaque China,” was made.</p>

<p>Leeds pottery is well known. At one time it had
quite an extensive Continental trade, and the pattern-book
of the pottery was issued in several languages.
Alas! now it is the French and the German and the
Japanese pottery books that are issued in several
languages.</p>

<p>It is largely cream-coloured ware and such articles
as candlesticks, teapots, mustard-pots, cruet-stands,
tea-canisters, and sugar-basins, with covers, together
with the usual dinner and tea services, that were
manufactured.</p>

<p>Bristol claims to have made pottery at a period as
remote as Edward I. Wherever excavations have
been made in the city, along the north bank of the
river from Bristol Bridge to Redcliffe Pit, remains of
pottery and shard heaps have been discovered.</p>

<p>Joseph Ring, in 1787, successfully imitated the
Queen’s ware of Wedgwood and the best Staffordshire
pottery. Ring’s cream-ware is thin and well
made, the edges being remarkably sharp, and the
fluted pieces very regular and well defined. It is
generally yellower than either Wedgwood’s cream-ware
or the Leeds pottery. Both of these have
coloured bodies, but Ring’s Bristol ware has a white
body, the yellow surface tint being obtained by
means of a glaze.</p>

<p>The mugs and jugs of Newcastle and Sunderland
are much sought after on account of their quaint
inscriptions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span></p>

<p>By kind permission, we reproduce some fine
specimens of this ware from the collection of Mr.
W. G. Honey, of Cork, which were on view at the
Cork Exhibition. Many of these jugs have a frog in
the interior of the vessel. As the liquor is drunk the
creature appears to be leaping into the drinker’s
mouth.</p>

<p>The mug in commemoration of the cast-iron
bridge across the Wear bears the date 1793. We
give three positions of the mug, and in the inverted
one the frog can be plainly seen. On the reverse
side are the following lines:—</p>


<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Sailor’s Tear.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent4">The sailor’s eye—a tear.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nottingham, too, has produced some excellent
earthenware. Wrotham, in Kent, had an old-established
factory. A dish in the British Museum
is dated “Wrotham, 1699.”</p>

<p>London and its environs has given birth to several
celebrated potteries. Fulham pottery has a worthy
history. Letters patent were granted in 1671 to
John Dwight, for the “misterie of transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
earthenware, commonly knowne by the names of
porcelain or China and Persian ware, as alsoe the
misterie of the stone ware, vulgarly called Cologne
ware.” There was, too, a pottery at Mortlake.
“Kishere, Mortlake,” is the mark generally used.
Isleworth had a small factory at Railshead Creek,
Isleworth. Much of the coarse pottery made here
was known as “Welsh ware.”</p>

<p>Lambeth pottery is well known, the art productions
of Messrs. Doulton having done much to popularise
their ware. In the middle of the seventeenth century
certain Dutch potters settled at Lambeth, and
made pottery tiles. Lambeth delft ware had quite
a reputation in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Some particularly quaint devices appear on the old
English jugs and mugs during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. They were used by the common
people who could not afford silver and for whom
glass was too expensive a luxury. They succeeded
the old leathern jacks and leathern bottles, and played
no inconspicuous part in social gatherings both at
home and in alehouses. Many of the mugs have two
(and sometimes as many as four) handles, which were
made to supply the needs of several drinkers.</p>

<p>These English mugs possess little artistic merit,
but they come as a very interesting link in the history
of the manufacture of pottery in this country. One
would have thought that the conquering Roman who
settled in various colonies in our islands would have
left some permanent mark on our pottery; that the Norman,
who possessed some artistic skill, or peradventure
the Spaniard who settled in the West in Armada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
days, would have taught the Anglo-Saxon a lesson in
pottery; but it appears that the principles of art fell
upon very stony ground in these islands.</p>

<div class="figcenter w325">

<div class="caption"><p>OLD ENGLISH DELFT MUG.</p>

<p>(Dated 1631.)</p>

<p><i>At Victoria and Albert Museum.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the national collection in the Bethnal Green
Museum is a barrel-shaped mug (5<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> inches high),
which we reproduce; it is painted in blue with birds
and flowers, and inscribed “William and Elizabeth
Burges, 24th August, 1631.” This delft mug is
believed to be of Lambeth manufacture.</p>

<p>A mug of elegant shape was quite recently dug up
in some excavation near Bishopsgate Street, London,
for the Great Eastern Railway extension. It bore
the inscription—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The gift is small,</div>
<div class="verse">Good will is all,”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span></p>
<p>and was dated 1650, which conjures up pictures of
crop-eared ’prentice lads and mercers of busy Chepe,
and junketings at the fair by London Bridge in days
when train-bands and Ironsides were as integral a
part of City history as were the C.I.V.’s of a year or
so ago.</p>

<p>Brown and chocolate-coloured body with yellow
dotted decorations is a very common form of this old
English ware. A Posset Mug, dated 1697, bears the
inscription: “The best is not too good for you”—evidently
a present of some sort, although much of
this class of ware was in common use in taverns, as
the inscriptions go to show. We reproduce this
dated Posset Mug in the accompanying illustration;
next to it, on the lowest shelf, is an old Fuddling Cup.
On the top shelf is a Cradle with incised decoration.
The other cradle has slip decoration by Joseph
Glass, 1703; while beside it is an old Posset Pot
inscribed “God bless Queen Ann.” These specimens
are reproduced by the kindness of Mr. S. G. Fenton,
of Cranbourne Street, W.</p>

<p>Puzzle jugs were known in the time of Henry
VIII. There is a puzzle jug at the Bethnal Green
Museum, which was made by Mr. John Wedgwood,
great-uncle to Joshua Wedgwood, and is dated 1691.
The principle of the puzzle is that there are three
spouts, each projecting from a tube which runs round
the rim and down the handle to the bottom of the
vessel. The top of the neck being perforated, it
seems impossible to obtain any of the liquor without
spilling it. The secret is to stop two of the spouts
with the fingers while drinking at the third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span></p>

<p>Other forms are the Tyg, a tall cup, with two or
more handles, and decorated either with names or
initials; and the Piggin, a small shallow vessel some
few inches high, provided with a long handle, and
used for ladling out the liquor brewed in the tyg.
The doubled-handled tygs are generally called
“parting-cups,” while those with more than two
handles pass under the name of “loving-cups.” The
word tyg comes from the Anglo-Saxon “tigel,” or
tile, and survives in the word “tilewright” and other
corruptions common in Staffordshire.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzle jugs bear interesting doggerel
lines upon them. One runs—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What though I’m common and well known</div>
<div class="verse">To almost every one in town?</div>
<div class="verse">My purse to sixpence if you will</div>
<div class="verse">That if you drink you some do spill.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Not a very good recommendation for a jug, but a
very profitable alehouse amusement from mine host’s
point of view.</p>

<p>Another bears the lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In this jug there is good liquor,</div>
<div class="verse">Fit for either priest or vicar;</div>
<div class="verse">But to drink and not to spill</div>
<div class="verse">Will try the utmost of your skill.”</div>

</div>

<p>There is a very quaint inscription on a four-handled
goblet, possibly a christening cup. It is dated 1692,
and has the sides decorated with rough devices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
Attached to one of the sides is a whistle; the mug
has written upon it in atrocious spelling—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Here is the geste of the barley corne;</div>
<div class="verse">Glad ham I the child is born.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The orthography of potters in the age before School
Boards is something to marvel at. Apparently the
following is the gift of an amorous potter to his lady-love.
I. W. has gone the way of all lovers, but the
little mug he made for his sweetheart lies on the
museum shelf, an object-lesson to all “golden lads
and lasses” who, as Herrick’s fair daffodils, “haste
away so soon.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ann Draper, this cup I made for you, and so
no more.—I. W.”</p></div>

<p>Dated 1707, in the days of the great Marlborough.</p>

<p>Some mugs have the precept, “Obeay the King,”
while others bear the superscription, “Come let us
drink to the pious memory of Good Queen Anne.”
One or two utter the toast, “God Save King
George.” A Gossip’s Bowl, dated 1726, has the
couplet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I drink to you with all my hart,</div>
<div class="verse">Mery met and mery part.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another old mug, doubtless sent as a present, has the
words—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“As a ring is round</div>
<div class="verse">And hath no end,</div>
<div class="verse">So is my love</div>
<div class="verse">Unto my friend.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span></p>
<p>There is one quaint piece of advice given to all
lovers who wish for success in their love affairs. It
is on a level with the Shakesperian methods adopted
in the conquest of Kate in the “Taming of the
Shrew”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Brisk be to the maide you desire,</div>
<div class="verse">As her love you may require.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Dated 1691.)</p>

<p><i>Victoria and Albert Museum.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the pronunciation
is as curious as the
spelling. We know Pope
makes “tea” rhyme with
“day,” as does the modern
Irishman; but in the following
lines “join” is
evidently pronounced
“jine”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Come, brother, shall we join?</div>
<div class="verse">Give me your two pence—here is mine”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>—an invitation issued to
the frequenters of some inn
where the brown jug bearing the inscription had an
abiding place.</p>

<p>Another mug essays to point a moral while the
toper is draining its contents. The potter who would
strew his moral lessons in stoneware had about as
much sense of the ludicrous as the gentleman who
used to mark the London pavements with the text
“Watch and Pray,” which he had printed in reverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
on the soles of indiarubber shoes he would wear.
On the bottom of a drinking mug the notion is quaint
enough—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When this you see,</div>
<div class="verse">Remember me—</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Obeay God’s Word.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For our part, we prefer the following, which has a
truer ring about it—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Drink faire,</div>
<div class="verse">Don’t sware.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A large bowl of Bristol delft bears on it “Success
to the British Arms.”</p>

<p>A fine breezy inscription, dated 1724, smacks of
the hunting field. One can hear the rollicking voices of
the eighteenth-century squires such as Randolph
Caldecott loved to depict. Only two lines, but they
ring in one’s ears as a message from the good old
times—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On Bansted Down a hare was found,</div>
<div class="verse">Which led us all a-smoaking round.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Not classical English, perhaps, any more than that of
the ladies from town who declare in the family circle
of the Vicar of Wakefield that they are in a “muck-sweat.”</p>

<p>A set of six plates bear a line of the following
inscription on each—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What is a merry man?</div>
<div class="verse">Let him do what he can</div>
<div class="verse">To entertain his guests</div>
<div class="verse">With wine and merry jests;</div>
<div class="verse">But if his wife does frown</div>
<div class="verse">All merriment goes doune.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is an exceedingly interesting Fulham ware
flip mug, which bears an inscription on it showing
that it once belonged to Alexander Selkirk, from
whose adventures Defoe built up his story of “Robinson
Crusoe.” Doubtless this mug accompanied the
Scots sailor to the lonely island of Juan Fernandez
when he set sail with the Cinque Ports galley—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Alexander Selkirke. This is my one.</div>
<div class="verse">When you take me on board of ship,</div>
<div class="verse">Pray fill me full with punch or flipp.—1703,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which suggests that it may have been a parting present
from one of his friends.</p>

<p>Jugs and mugs with portraits of Nelson are not uncommon.
A quart jug in white ware with crimson
border has a man-of-war in full sail on one side, and
on the other a copy of West’s picture of the “Death
of General Wolfe,” probably made by Thomas Wolfe,
of Stoke-on-Trent, who was related to the general.
On one mug is a view of the Thames Tunnel and a
portrait of the engineer Brunel, to commemorate the
opening in 1843. We give as a headpiece a Sunderland
jug from Mr. Honey’s collection, having floral
decorations in purple lustre, and having on one side
a picture of the “<i>Columbus</i>, the largest ship ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
built.” On the reverse side are two jolly tars, and
the inscription runs—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Thus sailing at peril at sea or on shore,</div>
<div class="verse">We box the old compass right cheerly;</div>
<div class="verse">Toss the grog boys about, and a song or two more</div>
<div class="verse">Then we’ll drink to the girls we love dearly.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mugs seem to have in former days been manufactured
to celebrate some political event or great
victory. There were the coronation mugs of the
present Czar of Russia, at the distribution of which so
many peasants lost their lives. The Transvaal War
produced no china mementoes. Mafeking buttons
and ticklers are more representative of modern
feeling.</p>

<p>To us these old English mugs are as the dry bones
which, if one is only skilful enough magician, resolve
themselves into dream-pictures, historically accurate
enough, of our forbears of the eighteenth century.
Our children’s children, when they come to examine
our everyday ware, will find little else to observe save
the legend “Made in Germany.”</p>

<p>The field of English earthenware is very large
and very diverse. We have been prohibited by
space from saying anything of salt-glaze ware, of
Elers, or of Astbury, and we regretfully have to
pass on without touching Leeds ware. But we
give an interesting illustration of a group of Mason’s
jugs of the celebrated “Patent Ironstone China.”
The largest of these jugs is 9<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> in. high. This is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
a complete set, as the writer knows of the existence
of a jug of smaller size, and another size between the
second and third largest, which make a set of
eight.</p>

<p>MARKS ON MASON’S WARE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We give, too, a set of
marks used by the firm
of Mason, from the early
days till the factory
ceased. In the advertisement
mentioned below
he says, “The articles are
stamped on the bottom
of the large pieces to
prevent imposition.”</p>

<p>Miles Mason established
his pottery at Lane Delph,
in Staffordshire, about
1780. “Miles Mason, late
of Fenchurch St., London,”
so runs his advertisement
in the <i>Morning Herald</i>,
October 1, 1804, “having
been a principal purchaser
of Indian porcelain, till
the prohibition of that
article by heavy duties,
has established a manufactory
at Lane Delph, near Newcastle-under-Lyme.”
The “Ironstone China” was patented
by Charles James Mason in 1813. It consisted in
using the slag of ironstone pounded with water
together with flint, Cornwall stone, and clay, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
blue oxide of cobalt. The ware is usually outlined
with flowers in transfer printing, and painted and
gilded by hand. Some of Mason’s blue plates are in
colour equal to old blue Delft. On account of its
handsome decorative effect it is rapidly rising in
value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Spanish golden red and canary coloured
lustrous dishes with Moorish ornamentation, and the
wonderful Italian majolica, with its copper and purple
and amber surfaces glowing like beaten metal, are
probably the early masters from which our English
potters took the idea which they adapted to the
decoration of their pottery.</p>

<p>In this chapter we shall treat solely of English
lustre ware. It is roughly divided into three classes—copper,
silver, and gold.</p>

<p>The copper or brown lustre was made at Brislington,
near Bristol, as early as 1770. Compared with
the Spanish lustre dishes, it is more rudely ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
and poor and inartistic in form compared
with their Arabic designs. Our English copper lustre,
or “gilty” ware, as it is called in some parts of the
country and in Ireland, may be sub-divided into two
classes. The plain copper lustre, in which the jug, or
dish, or teapot is entirely covered with the copper
lustre; and secondly, the partially lustrous ware, in
which some portions of the pottery are in relief and
are coloured with some bright pigments, or left white.</p>

</div>

<p>In the group of lustre ware, which we reproduce,
with the exception of the centre dish, all the pieces
are copper lustre. The three fine jugs are decorated
with turquoise blue, as are also the two cream jugs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
This blue, though it comes out white in our illustration,
is of a deep turquoise. On the top shelf, the
jug to the right is decorated with red as well as blue.
It will be observed that the spouts of the jugs are
in the form of a man’s head with long beard, and the
handle is the figure of a man’s body. The scenes
depicted on them are typically English in treatment.
A castle in background and a shepherd with his flock
in foreground. The small lustre cup has simply a
rough-surfaced band of white running round it. The
whole form a representative group of this class of
ware.</p>

</div>

<p>The best period in the copper lustre is in the first
years of the nineteenth century, before the introduction
of colours in conjunction with the coppered
surface. It may be observed in passing that the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
of producing copper lustre has continued in a
spasmodic manner down to the present day, the
latter specimens being of a rougher exterior and of
a coarser finish.</p>

<p>By the kindness of Mr. W. G. Honey we are
enabled to reproduce some fine examples of lustre
ware from his collection on view last year at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
Cork Exhibition. The copper lustre bust, 15<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> in.
high, is a perfect example of lustre ware at its highest
level. This specimen has no equal in any of the
public collections. Two other illustrations, one of
which appears as a headpiece, giving half a dozen
forms of copper lustre jugs, are from the same collection.
While the copper lustre jug, 8<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> in. high, is a
beautiful specimen of fine modelling.</p>

<p>With regard to silver and gold lustre, that in all
probability became extinct for a little time, but in
recent years the great demand for silver lustre
has produced a corresponding supply, manufactured
abroad for the English collector, but it is very inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
and easily detected from the early examples by its
coarse and dull surface and slovenly finish.</p>

<p>The places where lustre ware is known to have
been manufactured are at Brislington, by R. Frank,
about 1770; at Etruria, by Wedgwood, in 1780; and
by Wilson, in Staffordshire, in 1785; also by
Moore &amp; Co. and Dixon &amp; Co., at Sunderland,
about 1820.</p>

<p>Swansea, at the Dillwyn pottery (of which we
spoke in our “Chat” on Swansea), also, about 1800,
is known to have produced lustre ware.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500">

<p>Different processes were employed in producing
the lustre, but they all consist in reducing the metal
from a state of combination, by dissolving it in some
chemical, and depositing it in a particularly thin
layer on the surface of the pottery, so that it exhibits
its characteristic lustre without burnishing. As may
readily be supposed, the amount of platinum used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
the silver ware, and gold for the purple or gold lustre,
is extremely small.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450">
<img src="images/page_229.jpg" width="450" height="452" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SILVER LUSTRE TEAPOT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of the silver or platinum lustre very many fine
examples exist, and it is extremely popular owing to
its similitude to old English silver or plate. The
sugar bowl we reproduce, with beaded pattern and
fluted design, is quite in the style of the Sheffield
plate of the Georgian period. Of the three silver
lustre cream jugs, that in the extreme right is of the
same design, while the other two show at a glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
the beauty of form that silver lustre in its best
period reached.</p>

<p>Other varieties of this silver lustre are quite plain,
as in the teapot we reproduce (<a href="#Page_229">p. 229</a>), which is an
example of a slightly later period. This is a fine
specimen of the unornamented variety of silver lustre
which is undistinguishable from silver. In fact the
highly burnished surface of such a teapot as this
cannot be obtained on silver, the lustre is of a richer
and deeper quality. Alas! it possesses the dangerous
property of dissolving, like a fairy gift, into nothingness.
Elfin gold will turn into a circle of whirring,
dancing, mocking leaves, and if your wondrous lustre
teapot slips to the ground, it lies a heap of brown
earthenware fragments.</p>

<p>One word in passing to collectors of this ware.
Do not wash your specimens any more than you can
help, as warm water has a deleterious effect on the
lustre, and tends to make it less brilliant; we recommend
our readers to polish their lustre ware with a
soft cloth, and we wish them absolute and entire
freedom from all mishaps. Treat the ware lovingly
and kindly, it will never come again; the potters who
made it are dead, the modern imitator is but a poor
imitator, fraudulent at heart and feeble in result; if
cunning lie in his heart it is not in his finger-tips, for,
of a truth, his hand has lost its cunning.</p>

<p>Besides the plain silver lustre, there is a decorated
variety which is very handsome, and much sought
after. Sometimes the ground is of silver lustre
decorated in white, and sometimes the ground is
white with an elaborate pattern of foliage, of fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
or of birds, woven in silver thread. The rarest of
this variety is the silver pattern on a canary ground.</p>

<p>The first method, with the design left in white, was
produced in handsome and highly artistic styles, and
there is a pattern known as the “Resist” pattern
which is much sought after.</p>

<p>From Mr. W. G. Honey’s collection we have
selected a very good example of this silver lustre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
with design in white. This is of the “Resist”
pattern, its artistic excellence speaks for itself.</p>

<p>With regard to gold or purple lustre, the middle
dish in the group in our illustration is gold lustre ware,
and is probably of Swansea manufacture. Wedgwood
produced a gold lustre of remarkable brilliancy. The
dish above alluded to is decorated with stags and
staghounds, but in some of the gold undecorated

mottled ruby-gold lustre, the effect was due entirely
to the shape and to the lustre.</p>

<p>The reason that this variety is called gold or purple
lustre is that in the lights it shines like gold, and the
rest of the pattern in those pieces decorated with
flowers and floral pattern, glows with a rich purple.</p>

<p>This purple lustre shows more signs of the hand of
time than any of the other lustres, and it is nearly
always found to be partially worn off. We give an
interesting example of a jug with gold lustre ground
and raised coloured flowers from Mr. W. G. Honey’s
collection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the hope of the writer of these “Chats” that
Worcester and Derby, Bristol and Plymouth, Bow
and Chelsea have become something more than
mere names to the readers who have followed our
journeyings. The china-shelf has been shown to
hold the monuments of men’s lives. Behind the
delicate pencillings and the shower of rose-leaves
lies many a tragic story. Liverpool and its ware
is not the least of the great landmarks in the history
of English ceramic art.</p>

<p>In entering on the threshold of the history of
Liverpool, and of the printed ware stated to have
been first produced there, we find ourselves in the
midst of a controversy. If discussions upon points
of china-collecting were waged physically, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
opponents in their heat would have demolished each
other long ago with their own china collections, but
luckily, they have confined themselves to hurling
opinions and nothing more tangible. Philosophically,
they have agreed to differ, and have parted
good friends, to renew the argument another day,
or they have each gone to his last home and the
echoes of the conflict have come down to us, and
fresh battles are fought over the theories of dead
collectors. Up till quite recently a wordy war was
being waged over Lowestoft, and the laurels of that
much-disputed factory were in great danger of being
snatched away.</p>

<p>To John Sadler, of Liverpool, is generally ascribed
the honour of having discovered the useful art of
printing on pottery from copper-plate engravings.
He was the son of Adam Sadler, a printer, in
Liverpool, who had formerly served as a soldier
under the Duke of Marlborough in the wars in
the Low Countries. John Sadler carried on the
business of an engraver in Harrington Street, and
having noticed that some of his waste prints were
used by children to stick on to fragments of earthenware
obtained from the potteries, he commenced
experiments with a view of extending this application
to the purposes of decoration.</p>

<p>He associated himself about the year 1750 with
Guy Green, who had succeeded to the printing
business of Adam Sadler.</p>

<p>The secret of the manner in which an engraving
was transferred from a copper-plate to the rounded
surface of a bowl or a teapot, was well kept, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
was fairly obvious that in some way or another the
design was transferred to paper and then retransferred
to the china object to be decorated.</p>

<p>Sadler and Green, after working at the discovery,
applied for a patent. The value of the invention can
best be understood by the following affidavit made by
John Sadler and Guy Green, in 1756.</p>

<p>“I, John Sadler, of Liverpoole, in the county of
Lancaster, printer, and Guy Green, of Liverpoole
aforesaid, printer, severally maketh oath, that on
Tuesday, the 27th July, inst., they, these deponents,
without the aid or assistance of any other person or
persons, did, within the space of six hours, to wit,
betwixt the hours of nine in the morning and three
in the afternoon of the same day, print upwards of
1,200 earthenware tiles of different patterns, at Liverpoole
aforesaid, and which, as these deponents have
heard and believe, were more in number, and better,
and neater than 100 skilful pot painters could have
painted in the like space of time in the common and
usual way of painting with a pencil; and these
deponents say that they have been upwards of seven
years in finding out the method of printing tiles, and
in making tryals and experiments for that purpose,
which they have now, through great pains and
expense, brought to perfection.”</p>

<p>Two printers doing the work of a hundred tile
painters! The stupendous nature of the invention is
seen in the light of this statement. Caxton never
made a greater discovery when he set his type
moving, and the illuminated manuscripts of the
monks became the printed page in the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
common people. Josiah Wedgwood, with characteristic
foresight, saw the value of the work of Sadler
and Green, and his waggons made weekly journeys
from Staffordshire up to Liverpool laden with his
Queen’s ware to be decorated in the new style.</p>

</div>

<p>To come back to the
controversy for a moment,
it is claimed that
Worcester was first to
produce printed china.
There is at the Bethnal
Green Museum a printed
mug of Worcester, dated
1757. It will be remembered
that the date
of Sadler and Green’s
affidavit was 1756. But
a claim is made for a
third factory—Battersea.
There is a letter
from Horace Walpole to
Bentley, dated 1755, in
which he says: “I shall
send you, too, a trifling
snuff-box, only as a
sample of the new
manufacture of Battersea, which is done from copper-plates.”
There are also dated pieces of this Battersea
enamel with the design printed upon them, dated
as early as 1753 and 1754. In all probability Worcester
derived the secret from Battersea, as Robert
Hancock, of Worcester fame, who signed some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
the older pieces, was formerly an engraver
at Battersea.</p>

<p>(1756-1822).</p></div>
</div>

<p>In spite of this fact there is
every reason for believing that at
Liverpool, Sadler and Green independently
discovered the art of
printing on china, as their affidavit
declares them to have been engaged
upon it for seven years, which takes
them back to 1749.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the earlier potters of Liverpool,
we have little space to deal in
this “Chat.” Chaffers, a contemporary
of Josiah Wedgwood, and a
formidable rival of the Staffordshire
potter;
Thomas and
Samuel Shaw;
John Pennington,
celebrated for his punch-bowls
and for a very fine blue
ware, are all well known to
collectors of Liverpool ware.
We give the marks of these
factories, and of other Liverpool
makers: Philip Christian
(1760-1775), W. Reid &amp; Co.
(1756-1760), Herculaneum Pottery
(1790-1841). Staffordshire
had its Etruria and Lancashire
its Herculaneum. In the
earlier days of the potter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
classic names were much in vogue. A favourite
pattern in Herculaneum china was a series of the
towns of England printed on the pieces, with the
name in a medallion at the bottom of the piece.
The bird is the liver, being the crest of the city of
Liverpool, and was used at Herculaneum by Messrs.
Case, Mort &amp; Co. in 1833. The anchor mark is
between this date and 1841, when the factory
ceased.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that Wedgwood had his
ware printed by Sadler and Green and that Bow sent
to Liverpool to have the Liverpool designs transferred
to the Bow china, it is easy to understand how complicated
it becomes to determine with exactitude how
little or how much was actually printed at Liverpool,
because there came a time when the secret leaked
out and when other factories besides Liverpool and
Worcester began to print their own wares.</p>

<p>We reproduce a Liverpool mug, printed in brownish
red colour, representing a lover and his lass. It is
typically English in treatment and design, and it is
this quality which makes Liverpool printed ware so
interesting. There is nothing like it in any of the
Continental wares. The quaint and delicate English
pastoral scene breathes of the eighteenth century.
The refrain might run:—</p>

rural scene, and pity it is that more of our rustic
scenery has not found its way to our national china.</p>

encounter with two of his parishioners. There is a
grim humour about many of the eighteenth-century
decorated mugs and jugs which are a record in
ceramics of party strifes and of long-forgotten social
enmities.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Liverpool printed ware has
in it an element of decoration which some of the
other wares do not possess. Many of our readers
doubtless possess specimens of this black or brown
printed ware, mugs, or tiles, or teapots with old-world
scenes upon them like the landscapes of our illustration.
Shepherds and herds, fifers and fiddlers and
dancers, village-green sports, lads and lasses “dancing
the hays”—these are the homely scenes transferred
from the old copper-plates.</p>

<p class="ph2">WEDGWOOD</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pottery made in England did not exhibit any
marked characteristic, nor was it of much artistic
value until Josiah Wedgwood, by his genius, raised
Staffordshire ware to such a degree of perfection
that it was universally used on the Continent of
Europe.</p>

<p>Josiah Wedgwood, the youngest of a family of
thirteen, was born in 1730, and came of a race of
potters. There were Wedgwoods, potters, at
Burslem, in the seventeenth century. We give an
illustration of a puzzle jug having the inscription,
“John Wedg Wood, 1691” (see <a href="#Page_212">p. 212</a>).</p>

<p>Young Josiah left school at the age of nine and
was apprenticed to his brother. At eleven, he had a
most virulent attack of small-pox, which left him
a weakling. Later on in life, he had to have one
of his legs amputated owing to a weakness which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
always had after his first terrible illness. Physically
handicapped from the start, Josiah Wedgwood—wooden-legged
though he was for over a quarter
of a century—was the prince of English potters.
His genius was coupled with great business capability.
His inventions were eminently successful.
Starting with £20, which his father left him, he died
worth over half a million.</p>

<p>Thoroughness seems to have been his policy, and
prosperity always attended him. He interested
himself in getting an Act of Parliament for better
roads in the vicinity of the Staffordshire potteries.
He cut the first sod of the Grand Trunk Canal.</p>

<p>His aim was a glorious one. “Let us make all
the good, fine, and new things we can,” he said to
his partner Bentley once, “and so far from being
afraid of other people getting our patterns, we
should glory in it, and throw out all the hints we
can, and, if possible, have all the artists in Europe
working after our models.”</p>

<p>He allowed no imperfect thing to leave his factory.
It is a quaint scene one conjures up of the potter
who, when going through his works, used to lift
the stick he leant on and smash to pieces some
offending dish or vase, saying, “This won’t do for
Josiah Wedgwood.”</p>

<p>The beginnings of Wedgwood ware were simple
enough. In 1752, Josiah left Burslem to go to
Stoke, where he was engaged in manufacturing
knife-handles and like objects in imitation of agate
and tortoiseshell. Subsequently he entered into
partnership with John Harrison, of Newcastle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
their wares were made at Stoke. In 1754, Wedgwood
and Harrison entered into partnership with
Thomas Whieldon at Little Fenton, the most eminent
potter of his day. Shortly after Harrison disappears
from the partnership. This connection
between Whieldon and Wedgwood was a most
important one. Their principal manufactures were
tortoiseshell plates and dishes, cauliflower jugs, teapots
with crabstock handles, and agate knife-handles.
While with Whieldon, Wedgwood produced a new
green earthenware, highly glazed and decorated with
flowers and fruit, which was mainly used for dessert
services.</p>

<div class="figcenter w325">
<img src="images/page_251.jpg" width="325" height="248" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CUP AND SAUCER.</p>

<p>WHIELDON TORTOISESHELL WARE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The tortoiseshell ware now known by Whieldon’s
name is very beautifully made. Usually the plates
and dishes are hexagonal or octagonal in shape, with
very finely moulded edges, and having a mottled and
variegated arrangement in colour, which more resembles
marble than tortoiseshell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span></p>

<p>Wedgwood made snuff-boxes, and various trinkets
intended to be mounted in metal. These productions
of his were coloured to represent precious stones.
When the jewellers of London and Bath were shown
these wares, they considered them a valuable discovery,
the secret of which they could not discover.
But learning the low price at which Wedgwood was
intending to sell them they grew less favourable,
probably from thinking the imitation would ruin the
sale of genuine jewels.</p>

<p>We learn, too, that Wedgwood at this time was so
incapacitated from attending to his business, owing
to the remains of his old complaint, that he was
obliged to communicate the secret of the method
and proportions of his mixtures to a workman.</p>

<p>The ware manufactured by Whieldon, both during
his partnership with Wedgwood and afterwards,
are of good quality, and are highly prized by
collectors. A tortoiseshell plate costs a sovereign
to-day.</p>

<p>Of course none of these early wares of Wedgwood
are marked. We shall show how he laid the foundation
of his manufactory, which he called “Etruria,”
after the Italian home of the famous Etruscans,
whose work he admired and imitated.</p>

<p>What Wedgwood did for Staffordshire is shown
best in the following sentence by M. Faujas de
Saint Font in his “Travels,” who says, speaking
of the Wedgwood ware: “Its excellent workmanship,
its solidity the advantage which it possesses of
sustaining the action of fire, its fine glaze, impenetrable
to acids, the beauty and convenience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
its form, and the cheapness of its price, have given
rise to a commerce so active and so universal
that in travelling from Paris to Petersburg, from
Amsterdam to the furthest part of Sweden, and
from Dunkirk to the extremity of the South of
France, one is served at every inn with English ware.
Spain, Portugal, and Italy are supplied, and vessels
are loaded with it for the East and West Indies and
the continent of America.”</p>

<p>Leaving the biographical side of the subject, we
come to the actual productions of Josiah Wedgwood.
We left him in partnership with Whieldon. That
partnership ended, he commenced manufacturing
on his own behalf. He speedily found that one
pottery was not enough to satisfy his tireless
energies. He became the owner of two. In 1762,
he presented Queen Charlotte with a breakfast
service of cream-coloured earthenware. In return
he received the title of “Potter to her Majesty,”
and his Queen’s Ware became a great success. Every
fortnight a waggon left Burslem for Liverpool with
a freight of this ware, to be decorated by Messrs.
Sadler and Green by their transfer process at
Liverpool.</p>

<p>About this time he took his cousin, Thomas
Wedgwood, into partnership, and later Thomas
Bentley, of Liverpool, a man of great taste, who
exercised no inconsiderable influence upon the style
of design of the new pottery at Etruria. A man
of wide reading and culture, it was he who supplemented
Wedgwood’s practical efforts by his theories.
It was always Wedgwood first, but Bentley was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
an ideal second. He took no part in what Wedgwood
termed the “useful” side of the manufactory,
such as, for example, the manufacture of Queen’s
Ware and other articles for everyday use. Bentley’s
partnership was only concerned with the “ornamental”
side of the pottery, such as the manufacture
of vases and works of art.</p>

<p>In 1769 Etruria was opened, and Josiah Wedgwood
might have been seen at the potter’s bench and Thomas
Bentley at the wheel, and their united labours produced
the first vase, having an inscription which
runs:—</p>

<p class="center">
JUNE XIII., MDCCLXIX.<br />
ONE OF THE FIRST DAY’S PRODUCTIONS<br />
AT<br />
ETRURIA IN STAFFORDSHIRE,<br />
BY<br />
WEDGWOOD AND BENTLEY.<br />
ARTES ETRURIÆ RENASCUNTER.
</p>

<p>The subject of decoration is Hercules in the
Garden of the Hesperides, and was a forerunner
of those classical pieces which have made Wedgwood
as honoured a name in Europe as that of Palissy
the Frenchman, of Lucca del Robbia the Italian,
or of Böttcher the German.</p>

<p>The range of the Wedgwood ware may be gathered
from the fact that in one of the catalogues the productions
are divided into twenty distinct classes.
It is not our intention to enumerate these, but they
comprised series of medals and medallions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
Cæsars, the Roman emperors, the heads of the Popes
(consisting of no less than two hundred and fifty-three
medallions), a hundred heads of the kings
of England and France, together with “heads of
illustrious moderns.” In addition to these there
were admirable busts, some being twenty-five inches
in height, of Lord Chatham, Cornelius De Witt, John
De Witt, Plato, and many more. These were in
black basaltes, durable as marble. Lamps and
candelabra of antique forms were produced from
“two shillings apiece to five guineas.”</p>

<p>In passing, we may refer to the above fact to show
why Wedgwood or any other ware varies in value so
much at the present day. Obviously a two-shilling
lamp will not be as valuable as a five-guinea one.
Readers learn that certain china has fetched a large
price in the auction-room. Sometimes they erroneously
infer that other china they possess, which
bears the mark of the same factory, is equally
valuable. The above will point the moral of the
story. It is a fact that cannot be too often insisted
upon that the great factories turned out productions
by the ton, many of them intended for ordinary everyday
use, and though bearing their mark, yet not
valuable from the collector’s point of view.</p>

<p>There are, of course, other reasons why china is or
is not valuable, but this is a very solid reason too
often overlooked. To be able to differentiate the
good from the bad, “that is the question.” To know
that a specimen is good is one thing, to give the
reason why is another. When the reader begins to
do this he or she is already a connoisseur.</p>

<p>In order to give a fairly proportionate idea of
what Wedgwood ware is, we quote a list and
description of six different kinds of ware in his
own words:—</p>

<p>“1. A <i>terra-cotta</i>; resembling porphyry, granite
Egyptian, pebble, and other beautiful stones of the
silicious or crystalline order.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500">
<img src="images/page_256.jpg" width="500" height="303" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>WEDGWOOD TERRA-COTTA VASES</p>

<p><i>In Museum at Etruria.</i></p>

<p><i>By courtesy of Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>“2. <i>Basaltes</i> or black ware; a black porcelain
biscuit of nearly the same properties with the natural
stone; striking fire with steel, receiving a high polish,
serving as a touchstone for metals, resisting all the
acids, and bearing without injury a strong fire;
stronger, indeed, than the basaltes itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span></p>

<p>“3. <i>White porcelain biscuit</i>, of a smooth, wax-like
surface, of the same properties with the preceding,
except in what depends upon colour.</p>

<p>“4. <i>Jasper</i>; a white porcelain biscuit of exquisite
beauty and delicacy, possessing the general properties
of the basaltes, together with the singular one of
receiving through its whole substance, from the
admixture of metallic calces with the other materials,
the same colours which those calces communicate
to glass or enamels in fusion—a property which
no other porcelain or earthenware body of ancient
or modern composition has been found to possess.
This renders it peculiarly fit for making cameos,
portraits, and all subjects in bas-relief, as the ground
may be of any particular colour, while the raised
figures are of a pure white.</p>

<p>“5. <i>Bamboo</i>, or cane-coloured biscuit porcelain, of
the same nature as No. 3.</p>

<p>“6. A <i>porcelain biscuit</i>, remarkable for great
hardness, little inferior to that of agate. This property,
together with its resistance to the strongest
acids and corrosives, and its impenetrability by
every known liquid, adapts it for mortars and many
different kinds of chemical vessels.</p>

<p>“These six distinct species, with the Queen’s Ware
already mentioned, expanded by the industry and
ingenuity of the different manufacturers into an
infinity of forms for ornament and use, variously
painted and embellished, constitute nearly the whole
of the present fine English earthenwares and porcelain
which are now become the source of a very
extensive trade, and which, considered as an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
of national art, industry, and commerce, may be
ranked amongst the most important manufactures of
the kingdom.”</p>

<p>Of these various wares we give illustrations. The
three vases we reproduce are fine examples in imitation
of porphyry and other precious stones (see
<a href="#Page_256">p. 256</a>). The material is so hard that it can be
worked upon by the lapidary, and takes as fine a
polish as the real stone it resembles.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the celebrated basaltes or black ware, sometimes
called Egyptian ware, the vase we reproduce
as the first made at Etruria was of this class, and we
give two other examples.</p>

<p>We give two very beautiful specimens of the
Jasper ware. This wonderful ware was made in
seven colours: blue, lilac, pink, sage-green, olive-green,
black, and yellow. Specimens of this last
colour are very rare.</p>

behold those of Alexander and Augustus,” writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>

<p>Having dealt with the biographic side of
Wedgwood ware, and of the genius of the great
Josiah Wedgwood, and having enumerated the
various classes of ware originated by him, we come
now to the consideration of his classic wares, of
which the wonderful replica of the Portland Vase
stands as the most notable example.</p>

<p>In passing, we mention the celebrated service of
Wedgwood made for the Empress Catherine II. of
Russia, which took eight years to complete. It
consisted of 952 pieces, of which the cost was
about £3,000. This splendid service had upwards
of 1,200 views of the seats of noblemen and gentlemen
in various parts of England. A large service
for Queen Charlotte of views in black enamel of
palaces and seats of the nobility took three years to
execute.</p>

<p>To his celebrated “Jasper” ware, Wedgwood
devoted immense and never-ending skill to bring it
to its final perfection.</p>

<p>The use to which he put this jasper is well illustrated
in his series of beautiful portrait medallions.
We reproduce a design of a plaque by Flaxman,
representing the hands of France and England being
joined together by the god Mercury.</p>

<p>Wedgwood was enabled, by the patronage of
noblemen who possessed fine classic examples and
gladly lent them to the great potter, to copy some of
the finest specimens of the old art of the Greeks.
He was thus enabled to produce the celebrated
“Dancing Nymphs” and the “Head of Medusa”
from Sir William Hamilton’s collection; and to other
great collections he was similarly indebted.</p>

<p>In 1787, the collection of the Duchess of Portland
came under the hammer. The sale included the
celebrated Barberini Vase, which was dug up by
order of the Pope Barberini, named Urban VIII.,
about the first quarter of the seventeenth century.
This urn contained the ashes of the Roman Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
Alexander Severus and his mother, and had been
deposited in the earth about the year 235 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The body of this vase, now known as the Portland
Vase, which was composed of glass, is a rich dark
blue, approaching black. The snow-white figures
which appear on it are in bas-relief. It is a
magnificent example of ancient art.</p>

<p>At the sale above alluded to, the Duke of Portland
and Wedgwood were contesting hotly for possession
of the vase. The price had reached a thousand
guineas. At this moment the Duke, crossing to
Wedgwood, asked him why he wished to possess the
vase, to which the potter replied that he was desirous
of copying it. The Duke immediately offered the
loan of the piece, and the vase was thus knocked
down to the Duke of Portland, and Wedgwood
borrowed it from the owner for a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of the vase is interesting.
The Duke of Portland, as one of the trustees of the
British Museum, allowed it to be exhibited there.
In 1845 a fanatic dashed this priceless gem to pieces
with a stone. Owing to the defective state of the
law he escaped with a very slight punishment. But
so great a sensation did the affair cause that an Act
was at once passed by Parliament making similar
offences punishable by terms of imprisonment. The
pieces of the vase were skilfully joined, but the
fractures are still visible, as will be seen from our
illustration. It is now in the “Gold medals room”
of the British Museum, and by its side is one of the
fifty copies which Wedgwood made for subscribers
at fifty guineas apiece. The vase itself once changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
hands for eighteen hundred guineas, and one of
Wedgwood’s copies fetched two hundred and fifteen
guineas in 1892.</p>

<p>The body used for this vase was black jasper, a
body used on but three other occasions. The figures
on it were worked up and cut to the utmost degree
of sharpness and finish, by the seal and gem engraver—a
striking piece of reproduction. The original
moulds are still in existence, and Messrs. Wedgwood
still produce copies both in black and in a deep blue
ground. But the price is in shillings and not in
guineas nowadays.</p>

<p>Among the various catalogues issued by Wedgwood,
some were issued in Dutch and in French.
There is one, dated 1775, which contains a perfect
little essay to the possible buyer of his ware. From
the point of view of the potter and artist, he gives
reasons for the genuine work of art costing more
money than an unworthy and feeble imitation.</p>

<p>Wedgwood writes so simply and naturally that it
is worth the perusal of all who love china for china’s
sake, to ponder over what the master potter says:—</p>

<p>“The proprietors of this manufactory hope it will
appear to all those who may have been pleased to
attend to its progress, that ever since its establishment
it has been continually <i>improving</i> both in the
variety and in the perfection of its productions.</p>

<p>“A competition for <i>cheapness</i>, and not for <i>excellence
of workmanship</i>, is the most frequent and certain
cause of the rapid decay and entire destruction of
arts and manufactures.</p>

<p>“The desire of selling much in a little time without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
respect to the <i>taste</i> or <i>quality</i> of the goods, leads
manufacturers and merchants to ruin the reputation
of the articles which they manufacture and deal in;
and whilst those who buy, for the sake of a fallacious
saving, prefer mediocrity to excellence, it will be
impossible for manufacturers either to improve or
keep up the quality of their works.</p>

<p>“This observation is equally applicable to manufacturers
and to the productions of the Fine Arts;
but the degradation is more fatal to the latter than
the former, for though an ordinary piece of goods,
for common use, is always dearer than the best of the
kind, yet an ordinary and tasteless piece of ornament
is not only <i>dear</i> at any price, but absolutely <i>useless</i>
and <i>ridiculous</i>.</p>

<p>“All works of art must bear a price in proportion to
the skill, the taste, the time, the expense, and the
risk attending the invention and the execution of
them. Those pieces that for these reasons bear the
highest price and, which those who are not accustomed
to consider the real difficulty and expense of
making <i>fine things</i> are apt to call <i>dear</i>, are, when
justly estimated, the <i>cheapest</i> articles that can be
purchased; and such as are generally attended with
much less profit to the artist than those that everybody
calls <i>cheap</i>.</p>

<p>“There is another mistake that gentlemen who
are not acquainted with the particular difficulties of
an art are apt to fall into. They frequently observe
that a handsome thing may be made as cheap as an
ugly one. A moment’s reflection would rectify this
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span></p>

<p>“The most successful artists know that they can
turn out ten ugly and defective things for one that is
beautiful and perfect in its kind. Even suppose the
artist has the true idea of the kind of beauty at
which he aims, how many lame and unsuccessful
efforts does he make in his design, and every part of
it, before he can please himself? And suppose one
piece is well-composed and tolerably finished, as in
vases and encaustic paintings, for instance, where
every succeeding vase, and every picture, is made not
in a mould or by a stamp, but separately by the
hand, with the same attention and diligence as the
first, how difficult must it be to preserve the beauty
of the first model.</p>

<p>“It is so difficult that without the constant attention
of the master’s eye, such variations are frequently
made in the form and taste of the work, even while
the model is before the workman, as totally to change
and degrade the character of the piece.</p>

<p>“<i>Beautiful forms</i> and <i>compositions</i> are not to be
made by chance; and they never were made nor
can be made in any kind at a small expense; but
the proprietors of this manufactory have the satisfaction
of knowing, by a careful comparison, that
the prices of many of their ornaments are <i>much
lower</i>, and of all of them as <i>low</i> as those of any
other ornamental works in Europe, of equal quality
and bisqué, notwithstanding the high price of labour
in England, and they are determined rather to give
up the making of any article than to degrade it.
They do not manufacture for those who estimate
works of ornament by their <i>magnitude</i>, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
would buy pictures at <i>so much a foot</i>. They have
been happy in the encouragement and support of
many illustrious persons who judge of the works of
Art by better principles; and so long as they have
the honour of being thus patronised, they will
endeavour to support and improve the quality and
taste of their manufactures.”</p>

<p>Such were Wedgwood’s ideals, and he raised the
making of pottery in England into a fine art. The
inscription on his monument at Stoke-upon-Trent
shows the esteem with which his contemporaries
held him.</p>

Which he blamelessly and reasonably enjoyed,<br />
And generously dispensed for the reward of merit
and the relief of misfortune.<br />
His mind was inventive and original, yet perfectly

His character was decisive and commanding, without
rashness or arrogance;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>His probity was inflexible, his kindness unwearied;<br />
His manners simple and dignified, and the cheerfulness
of his temper was the natural reward of the
activity of his pure and useful life.<br />
He was most loved by those who knew him best,<br />
And he has left indelible impressions of affection
and veneration on the minds of his family, who
have erected this monument to his memory.
</p>

<p>The marks used by the Wedgwoods have been
few. It is usually the name Wedgwood, occurring in
various sized type from time to time. In passing, we
may say that the manufacture of china was never
attempted by the great Josiah. <i>His work was
earthenware and not porcelain.</i> But some of it had
many of the qualities of china, the more delicate
ware being nearly semi-transparent, as is china.
About the year 1808, and only for a few years, was
china made at Etruria, and then not to any extent;
consequently specimens are very scarce. The mark
on this china is the name <span class="smcap lowercase">WEDGWOOD</span> in small
capitals printed in red or blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter w175">
<img src="images/page_269.jpg" width="175" height="179" alt="Wedgwood and Bentley Mark" />
</div>

<p>On all other wares the name WEDGWOOD is
impressed, in some specimens in large capitals, in
others in small capitals, <span class="smcap lowercase">WEDGWOOD</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, though rarely, the name occurs in
ordinary type, Wedgwood. On other pieces the
name occurs thus:—</p>

<p class="center">
WEDGWOOD<br />
ETRURIA.<br />
</p>

<p>During the period when Bentley was associated with
Etruria the following were impressed:—</p>

<p class="center">
WEDGWOOD<br />
&amp; BENTLEY.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Wedgwood<br />
&amp; Bentley.<br />
</p>

<p>The general mark used during this period was a
circular one, the letters on which were raised and
not sunk as in the others.</p>

<p>The marks WEDGWOOD &amp; CO., or simply
the word WEDGEWOOD, are both spurious, and
were used by Messrs. William Smith and others of
Stockton, against whom the firm at Etruria obtained
an injunction restraining the imitators from using
the name “Wedgwood,” or “Wedgewood” with an
additional <i>e</i>. This was in 1848.</p>

<p>Of the varying vicissitudes of the Wedgwoods
since the days of the great Josiah, we have had no
space to allude. But it is sufficient proof that he
laid a very sure foundation to a fine business, inasmuch
as the firm is in flourishing condition at the
present day, and from 1870 have made splendid
porcelain.</p>

<p>His Queen’s ware, which he made for the Queen
Consort of George III., was the prototype of the
ordinary dinner ware of to-day. We reproduce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
quaint old Wedgwood teapot with queer design
upon it, representing the mill to grind old folks
young.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from Queen Charlotte to President
Roosevelt, but it is surely a singular record of a
great firm that the Wedgwoods made the new
service of china to be used on State occasions at the
White House. The design has been copyrighted,
thus ensuring its exclusive use. It is of simple gold
pattern, bearing the great seal of the United States
enamelled in colours upon it. The set consists of
over a thousand pieces, and was ready early last year.</p>

<p>In the conclusion of the journey round the china
shelf in this series of “Chats,” the writer trusts that
they have stimulated the interest of the readers in
their old china and have helped to solve certain dark
riddles, and to give pedigree to “family jars.”</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
